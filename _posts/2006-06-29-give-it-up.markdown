Just got back from a magnificently relaxing weekend on <a href="http://www.rottnestisland.com/en/default.htm">Rottnest Island</a>




An internet free weekend, which is not such a bad thing every now and then. Had lots of fun with Evelyn and Caren. I even managed to get Caren to ride a bike (something that has only happened _4 times_ in the 14 years we've been together!)




We stayed in Longreach Bay, and one night I wandered over to Geordie Bay, just in time to watch the sun do this. The only thing that detracted from a wonderful experience was that people on the boat on the left were playing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000032RS/002-0316106-7332005">KC and the Sunshine Band's Greatest Hits</a> at an extraordinarily loud volume.
