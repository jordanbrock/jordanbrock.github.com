I recently setup a new page on <a href="www.hotspotr.com">Hotspotr</a> that tracks <a href="http://hotspotr.com/wifi/map/661-perth-australia">work friendly, wifi enabled cafe's</a> within Perth. Check it out, and if you know a cafe where the owners don't mind you setting up with your laptop for an hour or two, add them in.
