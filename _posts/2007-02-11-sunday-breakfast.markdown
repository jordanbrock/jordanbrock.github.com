 I was waiting for a backup to finish running last night, so I was just wasting time catching up on some feed reading, and saw a post about <a href="http://www.deliciousdays.com/archives/2007/02/10/someone-has-nibbled-at-my-bread-web-bites/">making English Muffins</a> from what is one of the best food blogs there is: <a href="http://www.deliciousdays.com">Delicious Days</a>.

I had some time to wait, so I decided to give it a whirl. The <a href="http://winosandfoodies.typepad.com/my_weblog/2005/06/english_muffins.html">actual recipe is here</a>, and it couldn't be easier. The dough needs to rise overnight, so it's the perfect thing to make late at night. The dough is pretty sticky when you're making it, but it's fun to get the hands goopy every now and then.

Then this morning, I punched the dough down, cut it up into pieces, gave it a second rise and then cooked them in the frying pan. While they were cooking I fried up some bacon, scrambled some eggs and bingo: perfect sunday breakfast.
