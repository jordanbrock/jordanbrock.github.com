 <span class="caps">SPOILERS</span>: While I'm not sure that Tilda Swinton's performance was oscar worthy, and I don't think I agree with <a href="http://www.kottke.org/08/02/michael-clayton">kottke's</a> assessment of her character (I think what he sees as "weakness" was her morals surfacing against her career ambitions) and was to a degree a parallel of what Michael Clayton was going through, except that he managed to do the right thing.

I'm certainly glad that films like this are being made. The plot isn't spoon fed, and you need to be paying attention.

8.5/10
