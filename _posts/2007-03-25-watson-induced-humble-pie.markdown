As much as <a href="http://jordanbrock.com/2007/2/11/watson-induced-apathy">it pains me to say it</a>, <a href="http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/current/story/287132.html">Watson's throw</a> was simply brilliant. Fast, hard and accurate. Totally game changing.

It's hard not to see <a href="http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wc2007/engine/match/247478.html">South Africa's performance</a> as a continuation of their susceptibility to pressure in big games. True, the game was just a group match, but the two points that get taken through to the next stage are important, and you could tell that each team desperately wanted the win.
