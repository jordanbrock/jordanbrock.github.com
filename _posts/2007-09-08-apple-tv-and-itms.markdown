 With the introduction of the new iPod Touch and the addition of the iTunes Wireless Store for both the new iPod and the iPhone, does that mean that there's an update for the AppleTV coming soon that will let us browse and purchase music/tv/movies online? Surely that's got to be the ultimate. Sit on your couch, purchase an album and listen to it within 3 minutes, all using a remote.
