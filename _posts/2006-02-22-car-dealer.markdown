 The other day a warning light appeared on the dash of our 2003 Mini Cooper, saying something was wrong with the <span class="caps">ABS</span>, which doesn't go a long way towards inspiring confidence in a vehicle. It also didn't make me too happy based on the fact that we just spent $1500 on tyres for the car and here was more money needing to be spent.

So anyway, I'm sitting in the dealership waiting for the diagnosis and the dealer who sold us the car walks by. He now happens to be the general manager of the entire dealership. We get to talking and apparently they sell about 100 vehicles a month: 30 minis, 20 <span class="caps">BMW</span> bikes and the rest in normal beamers. That's a lot of finance!

And the problem with the <span class="caps">ABS</span>: faulty sensor. Cost: $380.
