 Xerox have revised their corporate design, which in current times means a new logo. With a new mission of course, that the obligatory new logo <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/07/business/07cnd-adco.html">doesn't say &#8216;Copier'</a>




And the new logo?

Which immediately made me think of this:

As <a href="http://myles.eftos.id.au/blog/">Myles Eftos</a> said on <a href="http://twitter.com/madpilot/statuses/574207292">twitter</a>: "Nothing says &#8216;copier' more than pirating someone else's logo"




<span class="caps">LOL</span>.
