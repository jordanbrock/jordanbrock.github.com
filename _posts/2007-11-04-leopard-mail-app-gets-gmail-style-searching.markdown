p. I'm going to jot down little tidbits I find while using Leopard, things that are good and things that are not so good.




	p. I like the revised Mail.app (though judgement still reserved on the <span class="caps">TODO</span>'s and Notes features). One thing I have noticed is that you can now do Gmail style searches in the main search bar.

	p. Keywords that I've found work so far:




	p. from:<br/>
to:<br/>
subject:<br/>




	p. Haven't worked out how to do date based searches yet, and folder: or mailbox: don't seem to work yet, but I'll post more if I find something.




	p. _<span class="caps">UPDATE</span>_




	p. I found some more in the spotlight searching help file




	p. date: eg date: yesterday or date:24/08/07<br/>
kind: eg kind: document or kind:movie (this find messages with an attachment of a particular type)<br/>
