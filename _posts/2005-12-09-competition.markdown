p. <span class="caps">GYM</span> (Google, Yahoo and Microsoft) are pulling out all of the stops to create the best service based websites. While we've had web based email for quite a while (<a href="http://www.hotmail.com">Hotmail</a> etc), it took <a href="http://gmail.google.com">gmail</a> to really get the ball rolling.




	p. Then they launched <a href="http://maps.google.com">gMaps</a>, which microsoft basically copied (and relatively poorly I might add) with their Virtual Earth site. Now, they've really thrown down the gauntlet with <a href="http://local.live.com">Windows Live Local</a>. I haven't had much of a play around with it, but they have "Bird's Eye Imagery", which is just stunning.




	p. I mean, do you want to see <a href="http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=40.035558~-75.182957&style=o&lvl=2&scene=1816711&sp=aN.40.035554_-75.183029_Carol%20and%20Marc%27s_">Carol and Marc's</a> house?
