p. 8.5/10




	p. People criticised the camerawork, but I felt it suited the film, and really helped involve you in the action. Need to re-watch the first two to determine if it's as good/better than the first two. Regardless, I really enjoyed it. And actually got to go out to a cinema to see it! <span class="caps">OMG</span>.
