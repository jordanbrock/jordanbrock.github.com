p. This blog has been created by me for two real reasons. Firstly, I wanted to try TypePad out, considering I had heard so much about it. Secondly, Caren and I are going to have our first child in 3 months, and I wanted to have some mechanism of easily creating a blog to mark that occasion. Just like every other bastard on the intramanet.




	p. So, pretty much the same as everyone else I suppose.




	p. And I also wanted some way of linking to, and putting information about things that really get my goat, such as human rights issues, poverty, hypocrite politicians and the like. Mainly so that I have some area where all of my links are stored.




	p. I might also recreate the Tripography blog that I wrote when Caren and I were on our Wedding Jaunt early last year.




	p. Rock.
