 Here's the second video from <a href="http://webindustry.asn.au/ideas4">Ideas 4</a> from last week. In this one, <a href="http://scenariogirl.com">Lisa Herrod</a> from <a href="http://scenarioseven.com.au">Scenario Seven</a> gives her "Usability is More Than Skin Deep" presentation.




Once again, there were a few teething issues with the camera. I framed it using Harriet as a guide, but it turns out that Lisa is a little bit taller, which means there's a little bit of wandering camera action going on for the first minute as I play with the tripod.

It was a great night. I wished I could have hung around a little bit longer at the end, but I had to rush home (sick children and such - all is good now) so I missed out on the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rosemaryl/2231150589/">trip to Fast Eddies.</a>
