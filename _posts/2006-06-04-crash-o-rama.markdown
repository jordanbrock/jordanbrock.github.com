 This humble weblog has been having some difficulties of late, particularly concerned with actually being available for the two of you to read. While this probably doesn't cause much of a problem for humanity at large, it's mostly annoying for me because I get a little email saying "Yo goober, your boring site is down."

So, in the interests of trying to work out what the hell is going on, I've killed all of the content (except for the wonderful selection of photos and links down the side). If the site manages to stay operational for more than the 45 minutes it did last time I will reload the archives. If it doesn't, well it will just fit in with the rest of my day (eg the catastrophic hard drive failure that just happened inside my PC).

And if it's really screwed? Well, I'm switching to <a href="http://textpattern.com">Textpattern</a>
