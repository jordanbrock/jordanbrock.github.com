p. So a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/markets/bonds/2004/11/22/1122automarketscan02.html">study was released</a> today that found that 6% of Macintosh users were Wintel users who had bought their Mac after they bought an iPod. Which of course everyone is taking to mean that the iPod is attracting people to Apples.




	p. Which, while true for some, takes away from the bitchin' ass coolness of the new <a href="http://www.apple.com.au/imac/">iMac</a>, and the funky mofo sexiness of <a href="http://www.apple.com.au/macosx/">MacOSX Panther</a>




	p. Of course, I'm still using my PC for just about everything I do. Except Skype.
