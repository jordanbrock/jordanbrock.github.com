 We spent a wonderful couple hours down at cottesloe beach with Paul, Dee and Olivia, and Tash (sp?) and Graham. Just sitting in the sun, enjoying the beach views, eating some rather good fish and chips and good conversation.




Of course, while sitting look at the sea thoughts obviously turn to the tsunami, and just how impossible it is to imagine the ocean rising continuously until it consumes everything. Something to be thankful for I suppose. But obviously, we have to do what we can (in other words ... <a href="https://www.redcross.org.au/Donations/onlineTsunamiDonations.asp">donate cash now!</a> )
