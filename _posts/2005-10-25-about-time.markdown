 It's finally here. After what seems like an eternity of waiting, the <a href="http://www.apple.com/au/itunes/">Apple iTunes Music Store</a> is available to Australian residents.




With various holdups and delays, attributed by many to a record company holding out for extra cash from the deal, the store launched today.




While I think that the $1.69 per single is overpriced (compare that to AU$1.31 in the <span class="caps">USA</span>), I would have to say that I am extremely happy at the album price. Most albums seem to be $16.99, which is a dramatic improvement on the $30 - $32 you pay on an album in the store.




So, <a href="http://www.justinfrench.com/index.php?id=139">like others are saying</a> my credit card had better get ready for some action!
