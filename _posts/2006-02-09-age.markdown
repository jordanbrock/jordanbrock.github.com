 So, I have to wear glasses now. Only for reading and working on the computer mind you, but still. My aging old body.

When I went to have my eyes tested (you know, the usual ... sore eyes, headaches, unable to concentrate) I asked if using computers non-stop would have caused any damage. "No, it's your parents' fault!" Good to know that it's genetics.

I'm not sure what the prescription is, but it's nothing traumatic. And a good thing to know that I don't have glaucoma.

Next, the cane.
