 <a href="http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/">This</a> is possibly one of the coolest things that I have ever seen! (In a totally nerdly manner of course. I mean, how else could you get excited about wireless plug.)

Basically it's a souped up wireless access point. It has the ability to extend your own wireless network, or act as a very limited one of it's own. That's pretty cool on it's own, but there's so much more.

It has a <span class="caps">USB</span> port, so if you plug a printer into it, you've got an instant network printer.

But the coolest thing (in my view) is the audio functionality. You plug it into your stereo, and then you have wireless audio streaming. Bingo. Using iTunes 4.6 on your computer, you target a particular speaker/audio output, and then iTunes will stream your music to your stereo. Sweet. No more cables, plugs, patches. No more crap.

And the coolest suggestion that I've seen (from Todd Dominey) is for a wireless iPod, where as you walk into your house, you switch the audio output on the iPod and Bam!, it's playing on your stereo. No plugging in. Just working.

Of course, all of this depends on whether or not the product actually works. And considering I don't know anyone who actually uses it, this could be all a load of conjecture.
