 I'm off to Japan! Melanie (my sister for those not in the know) is paying for me to go up there to set up her network. Now that could mean more pain than anything, but it's a free trip to Tokyo, and in my experience that's not something that rolls along every day.




With Caren due within 8 weeks, I am slightly apprehensive about going. Obviously I would be heartbroken if she went into labour and I wasn't around. But, nothing's going to happen.




This is ostensibly to try out the TypePad QuickPost feature, which no doubt is to try and replicate the "Blog It" button from GoogleToolbar. Not bad.
