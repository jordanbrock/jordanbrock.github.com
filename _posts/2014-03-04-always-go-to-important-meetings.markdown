I realise that Fran Bailey was advised by her doctor to not travel to Canberra
for [this
meeting](http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/liberal-leadership-ballot-decided-by-single-vote-after-victorian-mp-fran-bailey-failed-to-travel/story-e6frf7jo-1225805722739),
but wow, it certainly had some pretty dire consequences for the country. By not
going, and not being able to vote for Malcolm Turnbull, we end up with a Prime
Minister that says stuff like this:

> "We have quite enough national parks. We have quite enough locked up forests
> already. In fact, in an important respect, we have too much locked up forest.

> "Why should we lock up as some sort of World Heritage sanctuary country that
> has been logged, degraded or planted for timber?

And this:

> "We all know Tasmania has the lowest wages in Australia, it has the lowest GDP
> per head, it's got the lowest life expectancy, it's got the lowest educational
> retainment in the country and it's got the highest unemployment, and funnily
> enough for the last eight years it has had a government in large measure
> dominated by the Greens," he said.

That's right, the Prime Minister of Australia blames a minor political party's
influence over the past 8 years for long term health and economic trends within
Tasmania.
