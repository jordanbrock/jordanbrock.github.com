There's was [a story on the SBS news](http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/07/17/how-will-carbon-tax-repeal-impact-you) tonight about the repeal of the 
carbon tax, and how the supposed $550 savings will be passed on to people in Australia. To illustrate 
the effects of the tax and it's repeal they interviewed a bottle shop owner.

He started out by saying the electricity prices were a major cost of doing business, and that 
they had risen by 80% over "the past few years" of which the carbon tax played a small part. 
He then went on to highlight the energy saving measures that he had put in place to reduce his 
energy usage. He said that he had managed to reduce his power bills by 10-15%

All of which goes to show how the Carbon Tax worked perfectly.
