p. Caren, Evelyn and I spent a relaxing couple of hours at <span class="caps">UWA</span> watching Pakistan and WA 2nd XI play. Sitting on the lawn, with Evelyn playing around, and a couple of friends from indoor cricket is a great way to spend the afternoon.




	p. Of course, returning home to get involved in the middle of a domestic violence dispute with our non-english speaking neighbours made for a slightly stressful and non-relaxing late afternoon. We think all is relatively well now that tempers have dropped.
