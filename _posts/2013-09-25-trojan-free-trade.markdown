With the recent change of government, there is likely to be a change in
attitude to some slightly arcane Free Trade Treaty regulations. One such
regulation that the Howard, Rudd and Gillard governements all seemed to agree
on is that including a Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) regulation wasn't
always in the best interests of Australia. The Abbott government [doesn't seem
to hold the same
opinion](http://powerhouse.theglobalmail.org/abbott-open-for-business-and-multinational-lawsuits/).

The ISDS provides a mechanism for companies to seek compensation from a country
where they feel they were penalised due to the laws of that country. How is
that a bad thing? Well, take the case of Phillip Morris, the tobacco company
that lost it's case in the High Court of Australia. They argued that the
Gillard government's crackdown on cigarette packaging was unconstitutional
because it infringed their right to trade. The High Court felt otherwise and
ruled in favour of the government.

The highest court in a country rules against you, so you should suck it up and
leave it be, right? Well, not if there's a 24 year old free trade agreement
that includes an ISDS provision.

Australia is about to become a member of one of the largest free trade regions
in the world, the [Trans Pacific Partnership
Agreement](http://www.dfat.gov.au/fta/tpp/). The US is pressuring
Australia to agree to the ISDS provisions, which would allow, say, a coal-seam
gas mining company to sue the government if our environmental regulations
prohibit them from operating in Australia.

Great.
