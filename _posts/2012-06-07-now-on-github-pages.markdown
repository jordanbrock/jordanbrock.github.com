title: Now on GitHub Pages
---

A quick post to mark the fact that I've moved this site from a hosted wordpress install to 
"GitHub Pages":http://pages.github.com, using "Jekyll":https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll to 
generate the static files for the blog.

It's a remarkably simple system: Create a repository in github called _username.github.com_, 
configure Jekyll, and then commit and push your code to your repository. GitHub then
automatically runs Jekyll on your site, generating the static files, and then publishing the site. 

No more having your site locked into a database format, or using some blogging engine 
that can be compromised. And automatic backups!

Here's "my repository":https://github.com/jordanbrock/jordanbrock.github.com so you 
can copy the config files.
