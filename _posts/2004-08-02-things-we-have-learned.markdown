 In the last 24 hours, Caren and I have learned:

	<ul>
	<li>Eating Chilli Squid with Tamarind Sauce while breastfeeding is less than optimal.</li>
		<li>Sleep, however fleeting, is nice.</li>
		<li>All of the ideals we had discussed about raising our child go out the window on the first night.</li>
	</ul>
