 So, as of yesterday, we have been parents for 1 year. And I'm sure it's been said many times before, but wow, what a year. It's all been pretty much fantastic, and we have a wonderful little girl.

It's so cool to watch her grow and develop. Looking back through the photos from her <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mrsparkle/search/tags:birthday,evelyn/tagmode:all/">monthly birthdays</a> it's amazing to see the development that you don't notice on a day to day basis.

What we have noticed day to day recently is a real burst in mini milestones. In the last month she has:

	<ul>
	<li>Gone from waking up 3-4 times a night, to sleeping just about the whole way through,</li>
		<li>Started drinking out of her cup,</li>
		<li>Started eating on her own</li>
		<li>Free standing</li>
	</ul>

All very exciting.

We're off to <a href="http://www.rottnest.wa.gov.au/">Rottnest</a> tomorrow with Caren's work. Should be interesting. Hopefully we can obtain healthy supplies of alcohol.

Oh, I found out today that Dee is in hospital ... nothing too serious from all accounts ... just some bed rest. Paul must be working her too hard.

"Get mah dinner woman!"
