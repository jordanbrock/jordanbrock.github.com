p. A <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/tom-waits-a-conversation-with-himself-846164.html">great interview with Tom Waits</a> (by Tom Waits himself) that includes this bit of gold:




<pre>
Q: What's heaven for you?

A: Me and my wife on Route 66 with a pot of coffee, 
a cheap guitar, pawnshop tape recorder in a Motel 6, 
and a car that runs good parked right by the door.

	p. Also, make sure you watch his performance of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wfamPW3Eaw">Chocolate Jesus</a> on Letterman.
