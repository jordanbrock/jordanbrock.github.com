One thing that I can't stand is being late, and I start to get all <span class="caps">OCD</span> about things when I am running late. Tonight, I was supposed to meet up with Habu-san and Kobayashi-san at the Brass Monkey, but due to missed phone calls, I ended up being an hour late. Totally my own fault, and I felt terrible about it.

Nonetheless, when I finally got there, they were really gracious about everything, and then we wandered off to dinner. I had originally planned to go to the Viet Hoa, but we ended up at the Dusit Thai. I hadn't been there for years (Jen, James and I found ourselves there one night after some solid after work drinking). The food was pretty good, nothing too spectacular. Slightly overpriced ... it probably would have been better to get to the Viet Hoa.

It was good to see Habu again, and to hear a little about Koba-san's two boys (who seem to be little bundles of energy), through the translation of Habu. A very stilted conversation. Makes me want to get back to Tokyo as soon as I can.
