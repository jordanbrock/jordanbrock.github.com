p. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/movies/awardsseason/06lim.html">choice not to have a traditional soundtrack</a> for this film was perfect. It helped create tension, and the shoot out/chase scene before was one of the best I've ever seen. While a small part of me feels that the Coen's are treading over old ground, at least stylistically, it's certainly one of their best films.




	p. Tommy Lee Jones was perfect, with a world weary tone in his narration that said as much as the words he used.




	p. 9.5/10
