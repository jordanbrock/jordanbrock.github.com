p. Got an iPod Touch? Visit jailbreakme.com in Safari on your iPod, click on the button at the bottom, wait for a bit and then boom, you've got root access to your iPod and you can start installing apps all over the place.




	p. If you hunt around a bit you can get some of the apps from the iPhone that aren't on the iPod (such as Mail.app, Google Maps, Stocks.app and Weather.app) and you can pretend like you have the convergence device you've always wanted.
