 While discussing our trials regarding Thai food and Evelyn with Phil, the all-encompassing powerlord of M3 Design, I wondered the following:




What would happen if a couple raising a newborn in Thailand/India/Mexico (or any country with a predominantly spicey cuisine) ate some bland english/western food? Would a plate of Mashed Potatoes cause the infant to rebel against the blandness of the mothers milk? Would the lack of spice, zest and zing in the milk result in an upset baby stomach? We have a right to know!
