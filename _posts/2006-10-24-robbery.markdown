 In preparation for having to be able to work while in the US in December (we're going for xmas and such ... a plane trip with a 5 week old and a 2.25 year old ... mmmm, fun), and I priced out a MacBook Pro. It came to <span class="caps">AUD</span>$4613, which is a little pricey, but hey, it's a sweet machine.




As an experiment I went to the Apple US website, and priced the same spec machine. And what do you know? It comes to <span class="caps">AUD</span>$3818 at today's exchange rate. $800 difference. Just because it's in Australia? Even when you factor <span class="caps">GST</span> into it, it's still about $400 cheaper.




So, guess what I'll be buying in the US?
