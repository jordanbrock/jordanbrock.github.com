p. So, it's relatively hard to believe but Evelyn is one month old today! When you have a child some form of temporal distortion kicks in because it seems like she's been here forever, but at the same time it feels like only a few days ago that we brought her home from the hospital (and made the mistake of eating Thai!).




	p. Taking all things into consideration, it's been a relatively uneventful month. Evelyn is a fantastic little girl, solidly going about her business of growing. Caren has been doing an astonishing job of feeding her, while I try to do whatever I can do to help. Of course, that generally comes down to all the other stuff that needs to be done (work for money for food being of major import).




	p. We went out for our first family outing the other night, to a bbq at Smirka's house and then to indoor cricket. While it definitely took a lot longer with Evelyn than without her, it wasn't too much of a trauma. Just a matter of making sure we had everything, and then hoping that nothing goes horribly wrong. She didn't sleep particularly well while out and about, but mainly just sat there.




	p. One of the best things of having a child, and I'm sure this has been said over and over again by new parents everywhere, is watching them discover the world. Obviously Evelyn's world ends somewhere about 2 feet from her face at the moment, but it's still great. Every now and then she gets distracted by her hand, as it waves around. She doesn't know what it is, but it sure looks interesting!




	p. One month down. 17 years and 11 months to go!
