I'm constantly amazed by the talents of the people I work with at [Five
Senses](http://www.fivesenses.com.au): Photographers, musicians, and artists.
So I guess I shouldn't be surprised when one of the roasters, Damon
Steponavicius, pulls out an [amazingly eloquent piece](http://fivesenses.com.au/blog/2013/09/24/i-am-a-coffee-roaster) on what it means to be a Coffee
Roaster, and how Five Senses is managing that responsibility:

> We see the inequity in our industry, and our Green Bean team are witness to the
human toll the global market takes upon growers who remain predominantly from
the developing world. The beans that arrive on our doorstep are thus indeed
a gift from those far away, the result of years of hard labour and sacrifice,
of love and of craft. But this gift also comes with an unwritten legacy, and
a specific bequest:

> > ‘Do me, and my grower, justice’.

> And, crucially, our ability to comply with this unspoken demand is precisely
where our ability to invest has profound implications

Lovely stuff.
