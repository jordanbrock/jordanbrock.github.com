<p style="float:right"><img src="http://www.flickr.com/photos/217042_m.jpg" alt="" /> I'm trying to resist the tempation to turn this whole blog into one long post about Evelyn, but you know, it's really hard!




Especially when you get photos as cute as this one!




But for the 0.1 people of you actually reading this there has been other stuff occurring. Life does continue. Work does need to be looked at, well, glanced at at least. Some of this stuff will be written about, but in the meantime there's one thing I want you all to do.




And that's join <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> . It's a free(!) online photo sharing service, and it's just fantastic. My username is Mr Sparkle. Add me to your contacts list.




And then while you're at it, sign up for an account (free as well) at <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">BlogLines</a> and at <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>
