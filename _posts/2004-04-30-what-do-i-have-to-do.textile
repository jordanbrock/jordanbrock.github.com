p. What do I have to do to get a gmail account? I tried blogger, creating a <a href="http://tamarabuchi.blogspot.com">dubious blog</a> with a series of completely dubious posts, logging in and logging out, visiting the site from clients computers and the like in a random attempt to make it appear that it was an "active" blog.




	p. Did it work? bah.




	p. Of course, I've only tried doing it for about 1 week, so I don't think that really counts.
