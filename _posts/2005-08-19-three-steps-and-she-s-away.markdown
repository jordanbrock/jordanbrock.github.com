I was sitting down with Evelyn this morning, more in an attempt to prevent her from climbing all over the entertainment system shelving than anything else, and while she was holding several pieces of cardboard in her hand, she looked up at me and promptly took three steps. Just like that. Attempts to repeat the feat resulted in one or two steps here and there.



 
Caren and I thought she took one step yesterday morning, but you don't know whether its a real step or just stopping herself from falling. But today's were legitmate steps. Unfortunately Caren wasn't around to see it, but that just means we have plenty of practice to do this afternoon!
