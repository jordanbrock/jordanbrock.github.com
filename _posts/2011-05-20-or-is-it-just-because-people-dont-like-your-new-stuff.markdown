A quote from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Butler_(musician)">John Butler</a>
on the <a href="http://www.mipi.com.au/">Music Industry Piracy Investigations</a> site:

> "We sell about 40 per cent less albums than we did three or four years ago 
because of [illegal] downloading" - John Butler

Of course, it's got nothing to do with the quality of the stuff they're putting
out now. No. It's all because of the computers. Because computers weren't 
around three or four years ago.

_I found this site because they'd <a href="https://twitter.com/themaninblue/status/71407363302752256">just sent</a> a takedown notice to <a href="http://www.themaninblue.com/">Cameron Adams</a> over his brilliant <a href="http://daftpunk.themaninblue.com/">Definitive Daft Punk</a> mashup, which has got to do more to promote sales of Daft Punk than any threat of legal action will ever accomplish._
