> On the evening of November 20, 2014, Bobby Livingston, the executive vice president of RR Auction, was working late. The Boston auction house, a boutique firm that focused in part on objects that had been flown into space, was hosting one of its regular seven P.M. sales. Lot 477, an innocent-looking envelope with several inked notary circles and three stamps, and emblazoned with the vibrant Emilio Pucciâ€“designed insignia of the Apollo 15 mission, had a minimum bid of $1,000 on it.

Great story in the first issue of Gradyon Carter's new venture, [Airmail](https://airmail.news).
