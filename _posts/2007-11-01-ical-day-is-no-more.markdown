 File under mostly nerdy:

For years now, Mac faithful have "celebrated" <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2005/7/16/734">iCal Day</a>. The default icon for the iCal program was the 17th of July, as long as the program wasn't running. When you started the program up, the icon would reflect the current date.

Now, with the release of <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Leopard</a> Apple have updated the program so that the icon when iCal is not running has the current date.

Vale iCal Day. A short, but bright life.
