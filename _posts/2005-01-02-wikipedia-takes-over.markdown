 With some of the best coverage of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_Earthquake">Tsunami Disaster on the internet</a>, WikiPedia is showing off it's chops. A community managed encylopedia, it shows the wonders of open source content development. People submit articles, which can be edited by anyone who cares to, which creates a continually checked, living encyclopedia. And with stories such as the unfolding crisis in South-East Asia, it really comes into it's own. An authoritative resource on just about everything.
