 A couple of months ago, Radiohead held a contest to remix "Nude", a track from their "In Rainbows" album. It was a particularly difficult song to remix, due to the fact that it is in 6/8 time. James Houston decided to take a _completely_ different approach from everyone else, and rigged up an old ZX Spectrum, a scanner, a dot matrix printer and an array of hard drives to play the song. The result is just mind blowing.

Bear with the first minute or so of the video. It's the sound of it loading on the Sinclair ... which is a sound a lot of the _cough_ older _cough_ programmers amongst us will be very familiar with.
