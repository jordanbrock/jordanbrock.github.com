  Andre, it works a treat with Australian addresses. I've noticed that you need to use the full state name, or else Google can get a little confused.
  
  eg: "10 Bland St, Ashfield, New South Wales"
  
  It does the post code look up as well. Extra cool. Thanks a lot.

  Thanks Jordan.
  
  Great that you like Scouta.
  
  It also takes into account things you add, so not just based on voting :). Soon it'll be even more clever, and take into account descriptions and tags.
  
  Know any good local designers? I'm seriously in need of someone who could contract in to design, do some UI work, and icons. Flick me an email if you have ideas of people (or ideas for Scouta). Prefer someone with UI and design...but immediately need a designer for some page work and an OS X icon for the iTunes agent.

content: Unfortunately, eBay has become overrun with scammers selling gift cards that they bought with stolen credit cards - they&#39;re even selling the cards for like half of the face value (which they can do because it didn&#39;t cost them anything). The problem is that when Apple discovers a card you used was stolen, they can cancel your account, and you could lose access to much of what you paid for. As an alternative, check out <a href="http://www.tunezip.com" rel="nofollow">www.tunezip.com</a>, they sell legitimate cards at a reasonable price. I&#39;ve used them for awhile now with no problems.

One way around this is to enable gmail in Mail.app, and then copy all your gmail archived mails over to your MobileMe account, and then disable gmail. Of course, you&#39;ll then have 2 copies of everything (even though you&#39;ll only see one), but that&#39;s a good thing.

Of course, you could setup a rule in Mail.app to forward any messages sent to an @me.com account to your gmail account, and then archive them. I prefer to only have the one gmail address that I give out, so this isn&#39;t the biggest problem.

Same thing for Mac Mail: when you&#39;re sending an email, just click on the \"from\" dropdown box and select which address you want.<br><br>Though, you also have to also have your Gmail account activated on your phone.

Mac Mail makes it easy to reply by adding multiple domains to the set-up, however, this does not seem to be an option on the iphone. That being the case this is not really a good iphone solution - more an issue with the iphone.<br><br>Thanks for getting this far with trying to get to a single mail account, while trying to keep multiple domain addresses!!!!

content: A few years ago I started posting my photos in a livejournal group; and found one guy in particular often gave me really really useful critiques. He was so generous with his time; and clearly a professional who probably had a lot of work to do... i was really grateful. I ended up adding him to my friends list - <a href="http://kylecassidy.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">http://kylecassidy.livejournal.com/</a><br><br>Over time a certain girl started appearing far more often in his photos - in between all the photos of politicians, cats, vegan food and fetish models (not making that up). We knew something was up, and recently we finally got the "yay we got married in secret!" post. i really was pleased, like glowing happy-for-friends pleased, and the closest i&#39;ve come to meeting kyle was trading an email or two.<br><br>i think it&#39;s entirely possible to feel joy and sadness as we watch the lives of strangers online. there are humans on the other ends of all these wires...

content: Yeah, it&#39;s funny that what was inherently viewed as an anti-social behaviour (spending long hours on the computer) is in fact opening up new ways of experiencing emotions. <br><br>The other thing that weirds me out is when you try to refer to these people in another conversation. You say "these people I know" or "some friends on the internet", but you&#39;re not friends, but you feel as though you are. One day someone will come up with a term for those (non) relationships.

content: Regardless of whether their new stuff is more or less popular, the reality is that traditional album sales are declining fast across the board. The sad thing is that so many great artists seem to lack any insight into how they can generate a great income from other sources such as live shows and merchandising.<br><br>The thing that really surprises me is when you see this sort of attitude from up and coming artists. I really can&#39;t understand why a mostly unknown artist wouldn&#39;t want as many people as possible to hear their music and potentially become a fan.

content: There&#39;s no denying that "Traditional" album sales have declined. I just take umbrage at the blanket "PIRACY DID IT!" argument.<br><br>No matter what they try and do, there is no way that the industry is returning to the "glory days" of the late 1970&#39;s to early 1990&#39;s where they made astonishing amounts of money from CD sales.
