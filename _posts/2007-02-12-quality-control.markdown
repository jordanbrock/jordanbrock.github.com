The Police have just announced a worldwide <strike>cynical money grab</strike> tour, and have launched a <a href="http://thepolicetour.com">website</a> to fill you in on all of the details. Unfortunately, whichever company they have tapped to produce the site seems to have just reskinned an old site, and haven't even managed to do a find/replace particularly well.

Hmmm, I don't remember Mariah Carey being in The Police. Strange.

Also, I'm still a big fan of The Police, and despite misgivings about the purpose of the reunion, I'll probably go and see them if they come to Australia, but check this out:

Do they really need to charge $100 for "Premium Membership", just so that people can get their tickets early and watch a few videos? And if you choose the free membership, why do you need to give your credit card details? And why does it include a balance check, when they're not going to charge you any money?

*Why do you need my credit card for a free subscription?*<br/>

Now, I'm assuming that the band actually had very little to do with this, but why do you need to jump through hoops, just to join a messageboard to talk about your favourite band? Really?
