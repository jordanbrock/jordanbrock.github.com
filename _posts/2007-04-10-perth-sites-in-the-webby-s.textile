p. The <a href="http://www.perthfestival.com.au/">Perth International Arts Festival</a> website, done by the clever starfish at, um, <a href="http://cleverstarfish.com">Clever Starfish</a> has received a nomination for <a href="http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current.php#webby_entry_events">Best Events Website</a>. They are up against some big names, including the <span class="caps">BBC</span>, Mercedes Benz and Lollapalooza, so this is great news. Congrats to <a href="http://goatlady.wordpress.com">Kay</a> and team.




	p. And in the <a href="http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current_honorees.php?media_id=96&category_id=45">Honorees section for News Sites</a> there is <a href="http://www.perthnorg.com.au">PerthNorg</a>, run by <a href="http://www.norgdom.perthnorg.com.au/">Bronwen Clune</a>. Once again it's a fantastic site that is really pushing up against some of the established players in the market, and (I'm assuming) a fraction of the budget.




	p. So, as someone said on <a href="http://www.twitter.com">twitter</a>, "Go Team Perth!"
