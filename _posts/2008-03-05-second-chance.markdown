 I've noticed that as I grow older, it has, for whatever reason, become harder to become "inspired" (for want of a better phrase) by music. Sure, I love it, listen to it constantly and couldn't imagine life without it, but that real touchstone moment where my soul is moved by a performance or a song has become harder to find.




The first time I can remember being transfixed by a song I was jumping on a trampoline and "Message In A Bottle" came on the radio. I must have been 7 or 8, but I can remember the sensation to this day. Music had been around before that, but it had never been an important part of my life. That moment changed that. I realised what could be gained from listening to records, the radio, or whatever. Incidentally it started a lifelong semi-obsession with The Police, but that's a whole different post.




There was an undending stream of moments/songs/performances throughout the next 20 years or so: the performance of "Sunday Bloody Sunday" in the Rattle and Hum film,  the guitar solo in "Soma" by The Smashing Pumpkins, Open All Night by Bruce Springsteen, "Where Do I Begin" by The Chemical Brothers, "Lithium" by Nirvana are just a few that leap to my mind. Moments where I can clearly remember hearing the song for the first time, and knowing that this is the reason I love music so much, and enjoy being surprised by it.




Of course, one of the other great things about music is that it is completely personal, and as a result, you might look at this list and say "Bruce Springsteen? <span class="caps">WTF</span>?" But that's why it's so good.




As time has gone on, and perhaps it's got something to do with having kids and having a bit less of my brain available to devote to stuff like this, but that moment has become rarified.




And to today. I clicked on a link to a performance by Liam Finn on The Late Show this morning and boom, that moment was back.
