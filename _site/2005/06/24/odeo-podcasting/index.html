  <p>In the last 9 months or so, podcasting has rapidly gone from being an interesting technology being investigated by a few, to a full blown meme, and now the money is stepping in. There are several upcoming players, not the least of which are <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">Apple</a> , <a href="http://www.odeo.com/"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">ODEO</span></span></a> and <a href="http://www.sirius.com/">Sirius</a>.</p>
<p>p. Sirius is a satellite radio broadcaster in the US, who have launched a Podcasting Channel, that is being edited/run by Adam Curry (host of <a href="http://www.dailysourcecode.com/">The Daily Source Code</a>, one of the original Podcasts that set the ball rolling.</p>
<p>p. Apple have announced that they are going to integrate podcasts into iTunes 4.9 when it is released in the upcoming weeks. From what I can gather, this is not really going to be anything more than a simple directory of podcasts, the contents of which are controlled by Apple. They have got the ubiquitous Adam Curry on board, so it&#8217;s unlikely that it will be totally corporate. I do, however, stand to be corrected once the application is actually released.</p>
<p>p. Yesterday, I received an invite to create an account with <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ODEO</span></span>, which is an online podcast directory, synchronising agent and a tool that allows you to create your own podcast.</p>
<p>p. First impressions of <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ODEO</span></span> are fantastic. Great design, clear and simple user interface, easy navigation. Everything speaks of thought being put into the product. The site simplifies the discovery and downloading of podcasts. I&#8217;ve listened to more casts in the last 24 hours than in the last month or so. Absolutely fantastic!</p>
