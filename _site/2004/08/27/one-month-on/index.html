  <p>So, it&#8217;s relatively hard to believe but Evelyn is one month old today! When you have a child some form of temporal distortion kicks in because it seems like she&#8217;s been here forever, but at the same time it feels like only a few days ago that we brought her home from the hospital (and made the mistake of eating Thai!).</p>
<p>p. Taking all things into consideration, it&#8217;s been a relatively uneventful month. Evelyn is a fantastic little girl, solidly going about her business of growing. Caren has been doing an astonishing job of feeding her, while I try to do whatever I can do to help. Of course, that generally comes down to all the other stuff that needs to be done (work for money for food being of major import).</p>
<p>p. We went out for our first family outing the other night, to a bbq at Smirka&#8217;s house and then to indoor cricket. While it definitely took a lot longer with Evelyn than without her, it wasn&#8217;t too much of a trauma. Just a matter of making sure we had everything, and then hoping that nothing goes horribly wrong. She didn&#8217;t sleep particularly well while out and about, but mainly just sat there.</p>
<p>p. One of the best things of having a child, and I&#8217;m sure this has been said over and over again by new parents everywhere, is watching them discover the world. Obviously Evelyn&#8217;s world ends somewhere about 2 feet from her face at the moment, but it&#8217;s still great. Every now and then she gets distracted by her hand, as it waves around. She doesn&#8217;t know what it is, but it sure looks interesting!</p>
<p>p. One month down. 17 years and 11 months to go!</p>
