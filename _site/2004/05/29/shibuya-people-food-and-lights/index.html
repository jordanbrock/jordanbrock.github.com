  <p>A day in the office, doing some of the stuff that I actually came up to Tokyo to do in the first place. The computer company delivered the server today, about 2 hours late, with four (!<span class="caps">WTF</span>?) guys coming along for the ride. They brought the box into the office, and then all stood around staring at each other and at me. I wasn&#8217;t sure if I was committing some serious social faux pas, but eventually Habu-san came along and saved us. Apparently they were just waiting for someone to take the initiative and probably would have waited for 20 minutes if someone didn&#8217;t tell them to set it up!</p>
<p>p. They had it set up within 5 minutes and then scarpered off to home base. I spent the rest of the day squashed up in the office, trying to setup the japanese version of Windows. I pretty much got there in the end, so it probably went better than I thought. Probably a couple of hours work over the next couple of days.</p>
<p>p. After work, I went into Harajuku and Shibuya with Imei-san and Habu-san to have a walk around, some dinner and drinks. Plenty of time gawking at all the buildings, and all the lights. Shibuya is extremely hard to describe: total chaos of people, buildings, cars and light is probably the best way. Times Square after a hard night on the tiles might be another.</p>
<p>p. It was quite an effort to find somewhere for dinner, but we eventually found an okonomiyaki restaurant. It&#8217;s a kind of pancake mixed with vegetables and meat and all sorts of stuff, which they cook on the hotplate that&#8217;s in the middle of the table. We had three different kinds, and they were all delicious.</p>
<p>p. A couple of beers with dinner on my ownsome, as neither of my companions drank! Which meant I was of course drinking for Australia. Don&#8217;t worry. I did us proud. Mostly.</p>
<p>p. Of course, the most interesting thing to do in Shibuya is to just walk around experiencing it. An astounding number of people, all going in seemingly random directions. It could take 1 minute to cross a 20 metre road because of the volume of people. I felt a little like a spawning salmon swimming upstream.</p>
<p>p. A fair bit of walking, and looking like a complete tourist snapping pictures of everything, and then we found a little bar that Habu-san had been to before. Of course, if you didn&#8217;t know it was there you&#8217;d have no chance because it was on the fourth floor of a building down a little alleyway up a hill. And then it only had about 8 seats. We walked in, and everyone in the bar had to rearrange themselves so that we could get in. But it was worth it because I had some of the best ginnantonix I&#8217;ve had in a long time (lime, not lemon), and a good translated conversation with the bar staff. Great feel to the place, and an astounding range of whiskey.</p>
<p>p. A great night out in chaos.</p>
