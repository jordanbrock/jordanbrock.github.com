  <p>I&#8217;ve noticed that as I grow older, it has, for whatever reason, become harder to become &#8220;inspired&#8221; (for want of a better phrase) by music. Sure, I love it, listen to it constantly and couldn&#8217;t imagine life without it, but that real touchstone moment where my soul is moved by a performance or a song has become harder to find.</p>
<p>p. The first time I can remember being transfixed by a song I was jumping on a trampoline and &#8220;Message In A Bottle&#8221; came on the radio. I must have been 7 or 8, but I can remember the sensation to this day. Music had been around before that, but it had never been an important part of my life. That moment changed that. I realised what could be gained from listening to records, the radio, or whatever. Incidentally it started a lifelong semi-obsession with The Police, but that&#8217;s a whole different post.</p>
<p>p. There was an undending stream of moments/songs/performances throughout the next 20 years or so: the performance of &#8220;Sunday Bloody Sunday&#8221; in the Rattle and Hum film,  the guitar solo in &#8220;Soma&#8221; by The Smashing Pumpkins, Open All Night by Bruce Springsteen, &#8220;Where Do I Begin&#8221; by The Chemical Brothers, &#8220;Lithium&#8221; by Nirvana are just a few that leap to my mind. Moments where I can clearly remember hearing the song for the first time, and knowing that this is the reason I love music so much, and enjoy being surprised by it.</p>
<p>p. Of course, one of the other great things about music is that it is completely personal, and as a result, you might look at this list and say &#8220;Bruce Springsteen? &#8221;caps&quot;&gt;WTF</span>?&quot; But that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so good.</p>
<p>p. As time has gone on, and perhaps it&#8217;s got something to do with having kids and having a bit less of my brain available to devote to stuff like this, but that moment has become rarified.</p>
<p>p. And to today. I clicked on a link to a performance by Liam Finn on The Late Show this morning and boom, that moment was back.</p>
