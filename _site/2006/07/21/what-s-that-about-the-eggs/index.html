<article class="post">
  <p>In an unintentional, but happy set of circumstances I ended up watching a couple of Natalie Portman (<span class="caps">OMG</span> <span class="caps">SO <span class="caps">HOTT</span></span>!) movies over the past couple of days: <strong>Closer</strong> and <strong>V For Vendetta</strong>.</p>
<p>p. I thought both were excellent films, and that Ms Portman, often criticised for not being the most emotional actress around, was fantastic (an opinion no doubt helped by her aforementioned hottitude).</p>
<p>p. I have one question about each film however:</p>
<p>p. In V for Vendetta, what&#8217;s the point with the two guys cooking her the same egg breakfast? Is it to symbolise that she&#8217;s a prisoner in both of their houses? Or that both men, though different people, aim to do the same thing, albeit via different methodologies? Or were they in cahoots?</p>
<p>p. In Closer, (<span class="caps">SPOILER</span> <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ALERT</span></span>), we learn at the end that her name is Jane Jones, the name she said was her real name to Clive Owen&#8217;s character in the strip club, though he wouldn&#8217;t believe her. So, what&#8217;s the point of that? Am I dense? Should I stop watching films completely?</p>
