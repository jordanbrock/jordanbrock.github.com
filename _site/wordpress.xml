		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, after a monumental collection of flights, changes and coffees in British Airways Business Lounges, we have arrived in Stockholm. Damn it&#8217;s cold.</p>


	<p>The &#8220;quaint&#8221; boat hostel that looked ever so nice on it&#8217;s web site, has turned out to not be quite as advertised. A room the size of somewhere you&#8217;d put your vacuum, and communal showers. I suppose that&#8217;s part of being in Sweden. So, we are on our way to the visitors centre to look for something better for when we come back from Kiruna.</p>


	<p>Stockholm is magnificent. Very clean and utilitarian, with an astounding preponderance of women walking babys in prams. We walked for 10 minutes and probably saw 25 separate prams. Babies all rugged up in bundling clothes. There must be some government grant promoting vigorous procreation.</p>


	<p>Using a swedish keyboard is a herculean task, so after I leave you with some choice characters, it&#8217;s goodbye from us.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Stockholm and the missing ugly people</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, we were wandering around relatively aimlessly today, when it slowly began to dawn on us that there was something wrong with the crowds of people in Stockholm. It took us a while, but then we realised what was bugging us. There are no ugly people in this city. Not one. Well, maybe one now that I&#8217;m here, but otherwise not a skerrick of ugliness to be found.</p>


	<p>Shop assistants, people on the street, coffee shop workers: hell, even the homeless people (all three of them) are at worst plain looking. It&#8217;s very strange. Kind of like walking around with no one but Stepford children to be seen. (And yes, a large number of them are blonde &#8230; and some even have pigtails.) One other thing to note: lot&#8217;s of mullets (the haircuts that is &#8230; not the fish), so all of you who doubted me when I said the mullet is back (namely you Dave) I say &#8220;Hah&#8221;</p>


	<p>Other than be flabbergasted at the all round gorgeousness of the population, we&#8217;ve been astounded and quite often astounded and amazed at how beautiful the buildings and the city itself is. I suppose that it&#8217;s only right that the scenery is attractive: to have beautiful people in a concrete block wonderland just wouldn&#8217;t be right. Wonderful old buildings, funky new ones, museums that could be just exhibit the buildings themselves and a stunning river through the middle of it all make a stunning city.</p>


	<p>Speaking of the river, we walked across it today. Without a bridge. It has frozen solid in parts, and we strolled across a stretch of about 800 metres. Quite exhilarating, particularly when Caren walked across a bit and a crack was heard. Made us walk a bit faster I can tell you.</p>


	<p>We also think we&#8217;ve solved the mystery of the babies as well. As some of you may know, Sweden is quite a socialist state: lots of government payments, support networks etc etc. (Massive tax rates as well, but I suppose you have to expect that.) So, it appears that new mothers get a fair whack of cash for having the baby (probably not as a lump sum, but you never know!), which allows them to stay at home and raise the kid. Of course, they don&#8217;t stay at home. They all seem to do nothing apart from walk around with the kids looking dangerously cute in beanies and mittens in particularly expensive looking prams.</p>


	<p>I suppose that&#8217;s all that&#8217;s happened today. Oh, we went to the National Museum. Which was nice. Lot&#8217;s of cool industrial design stuff, including the funkiest damn microwave you&#8217;ve ever seen. Of course, it was made in 1964 so it probably cooked your brain while it was defrosting the chicken, but at least it added that bit of class to your kitchen. I&#8217;d show you a photo, but we weren&#8217;t allowed to take a camera in.</p>


	<p>Speaking of photos, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be able to upload any until Philadelphia next weekend. Not many of the internet cafe&#8217;s seem particularly keen on me loading photos onto their computers. So, that may just have to wait.</p>


	<p>That&#8217;s it. And just because I can, here&#8217;s some more of those whacky Swedish characters: ?, ?. heheheh.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>It&#039;s Cold Guinevere, Damn cold!</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a long day walking around being dumbfounded by the attractive city of Stockholm, we made our way out to Stockholm Airport (courtesy of a $100 taxi ride thank you very much!!!). We got our seats on a very full plane (a truckload of Japanese tourists on an &#8220;Adventure Holiday&#8221; and a lot of Swedes going home for the weekend) for Kiruna, above the Artic Circle.</p>


	<p>Arriving at Kiruna the captain said that the ground temperature was -2C. The lady checking us into our hotel said &#8220;That&#8217;s not cold. 2 weeks ago it was -35C!&#8221; This only made us glad that we weren&#8217;t here 2 weeks ago.</p>


	<p>After a marvellous sleep in a toasty warm room atop a block like hotel/hostel, we woke up for our first glimpse of Kiruna. A fairly plain mining town (there&#8217;s an enormous mine on the other side of town &#8230; apparently the deepest iron ore mine in the world), made spectacular by two feet of snow covering everything. Snow, it seems, has a marvellous propensity to hide everything and make it all look pristine. Of course, the remnants of dogs visiting the park tends to break up the marvellous white landscape, but there&#8217;s not a great deal you can do about that I suppose &#8230; just hope for more snow.</p>


	<p>We set off walking into the town centre. After walking through the town centre in all of 2 minutes, we hoofed it down towards a large lake &#8230; frozen solid of course. On the way we got sidetracked by the sight of a hundred or so skiers flying down a mountain. Having worked out way up the hill, it turned out that it was a saturday morning ski carnival for school kids. Just like a little athletics meet, or a swimming carnival, there was a multitude of brightly clad kids haring around the mountain. All of them were exhibiting phenomenal skills with a large number of 8 year olds almost airborne down the mountain without any ski poles. Caren and I tried to come up with some Australian/American skill that we could do inately, but stopped short. I suppose that comes from not being overly athletic.</p>


	<p>With not a lot to do in Kiruna except walk around, waiting for the day to go out to the ice hotel, trying to save some money to make up for horrendously overpriced cab rides in Stockholm, we have decided to catch the train across to Narvik in Norway tomorrow. Apparently the scenery is quite magnificent, what with the fjords and the like. A three hour train ride there and back, but probably more interesting than walking around a mining town.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Boy George, Manly Men and Fjords</title>
		<link>http://jordanbrock.com/2003/02/23/boy-george-manly-men-and-fjords/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sitting in a cafe in the train station at Narvik, Norway and onto the radio pops Boy George singing &#8220;Do you really want to hurt me?&#8221;. Well, given the type of manly man that walks and works around Narvik I would hazard a guess that if Boy George turned up he would know the answer to that question within about 2 minutes. A tough looking town.</p>


	<p>Primarily a port for the iron ore trains from the interior of Scandinavia, there&#8217;s not a lot to Narvik. Except for the Fjord of course. Stupendous views of mountains crashing down to the sea. The cold, cold sea. And wind as well. Damn cold wind. The weather was quite grey today, but despite that it&#8217;s pretty specatular.</p>


	<p>The best thing about Narvik is probably the train ride there (and by extension the train ride out is pretty damn good as well). Plunging cliffs, massive snow drifts, people zipping around on snow mobiles, reindeer tracks (a lack of reindeer though), and the occasional half frozen river.</p>


	<p>The swedes have a reputation for being fairly a no nonsense, slightly plain people. Judging from their Saturday night television, there&#8217;s probably nothing wrong with that reputation. First up last night was a game show with two teams, each sitting at a piano, where it appeared that all they had to do to win was to sing a bunch of songs. To some fat bald guy who was hosting the show. Then after that was one of the more interesting television shows I have ever seen. Bingo. That&#8217;s right, Bingo. Approximately 2 hours of people playing bingo in a television studio. With an audience watching (but not playing!). Granted, the prize money (from what I could work out) was about $200,000 so I suppose there&#8217;s nothing wrong with playing bingo. But do they really have to televise it?</p>


	<p>Interspersing the Bingo frivolity was a lot of ads for satellite TV, spruiking the benefits of 24 hour channels, continuous sports and what looked to be rather racy movies about pool cleaners and window washers. I suppose that they were working on the principle that anyone desparate enought to watch two hours of Bingo on a Saturday night is the right kind of person to make a snap decision about satellite TV (says he who A: has satellite TV and B: was watching Bingo on a Saturday night.)</p>


	<p>Not that there is much else to do in Kiruna on a Saturday night. We couldn&#8217;t find any pubs while we were walking around, and any restaurant is likely to charge you a figure set to remedy a foreign trade defecit for a small bowl of pasta, so watching other people play bingo isn&#8217;t such a bad way to spend the night.</p>


	<p>We&#8217;re off to the ice hotel tomorrow. Husky rides, late night snow mobile rides to look at the Northern Lights, beds made of ice, vodka served in glasses made of ice and of course a wedding in a church made of ice. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll have something to write about.</p>


	<p>Oh yeah, I finally saw an ugly swede. I think that she must act as a sinkhole for all the ugliness in the country. It looks like the police gave her a Rodney King style beating with a branch from the ugly tree. Poor woman.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a 10 minute bus trip that cost $30, we finally made it to the Ice Hotel. A collection of small chalets/huts, surrounding the Ice Hotel proper, it is set on the shores of a lake, which of course is pretty much frozen solid. Well, to a depth of 1 metre at least. And it&#8217;s easily 1Km wide and 5 Km long, so it&#8217;s pretty impressive.</p>


	<p>The Ice Hotel is colder inside than out during the day. It&#8217;s been about 0C as a maximum for the past few days. And inside the hotel is -5C. We had a peek around &#8230; it&#8217;s open to the public until 6pm, when the guests can move in. Pretty spectacular let me tell you. Lots of little rooms, which are nothing more than an ice cube with a bed in it (cheapest). Then there are Ice Suites, which area themed rooms, with various ice sculptures and weird shaped beds. For example, there are Viking ship beds being pulled along by ice dogs, a MacBeth themed room, complete with ice statues of Lady MacBeth and the witches carved into the wall and a fertility room, with sperm carved into the wall, swimming around the edge of the room towards a whopping great egg above the bed. Talk about pressure.</p>


	<p>We are in a chalet for the first two nights. Very cosy, a stereotypical swede hut. Lots of pine on the walls, pine furniture, pine sinks .. you get the picture. Thankfully there are heaps of heaters. Up to 2 per room, which is very nice when you come back inside after a night haring through the forests on a snowmobile.</p>


	<p>Speaking of which, last night we went on a Snowmobile ride. You might think they look fun, but let me tell you they&#8217;re damn hot fun. At first they are quite tricky to get the hang of, particularly at slower speeds. But once you get to open them up a little, sweeeeet.</p>


	<p>We rode through the forest for about 30 minutes until we arrived at some little huts where we were going to have dinner. Thankfully they had a lovely fire going inside, where the guides were cooking moose goulash and salmon sandwiches. Very tasty. Moose is pretty damn good. Along with some LingonBerry juice, which is a native wild berry from around here that the local Sami (reindeer farmers) drink. Also tasty.</p>


	<p>After dinner, we came back to the Ice Hotel via the river, which meant we got a chance to crank up the snowmobiles. Huge fun, flying along at around 70-80kmh in the dark, along a frozen river bed. Needless to say, Caren didn&#8217;t think it was as much fun as I did, but I was the one driving, so &#8220;Hah&#8221;. I&#8217;d love to do it again, but it&#8217;s about $400 a person, so I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s going to happen.</p>


	<p>When we got back to the hotel, we went to the ice bar, and had a couple of drinks in ice glasses. As you could expect, this is more of a novelty than anything. Of course, if you aren&#8217;t wearing your gloves then it sticks to your hand. It&#8217;s -9C inside the bar, which either encourages you to drink faster to have more drinks, or drink faster to get out.</p>


	<p>After a few rounds, we walked outside and saw a greenish cloud, slightly swirling. We weren&#8217;t sure if it was the Aurora or not, but all of a sudden it exploded in a blaze of greens and blues, flying all over the sky. Quite amazing. Then after a burst of activity, it seemed to spread out across the whole sky, and just slowly fade in and out.</p>


	<p>We also had a run through of the wedding ceremony with the &#8220;Wedding Organiser&#8221; here. Should be interesting. There will be an interpreter &#8230; and apparently we have to sing a swedish hymn, which neither of us are too thrilled about.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So the day has finally arrived. We didn&#8217;t have any activities planned, other than the wedding itself, so it was a pretty quiet day until a quick flurry of activity towards the end.</p>


	<p>We went for a walk across the river in the morning, and watched the swedish army doing parachute practice onto the frozen river. Not quite what you see everyday, so it was pretty interesting. After dropping four lots of chutists, the plane did a very low fly by over the lake (about 10 metres or so), before flying off to pick up another bunch of human drop bunnies.</p>


	<p>It was quite &#8220;warm&#8221; today .. just 0C. Walking around in the overalls that the hotel supplies was actually quite a hot activity, and the temptation is there to take half of the gear off. Until of course you realise that it&#8217;s 0C, and that just ain&#8217;t anything other than cold.</p>


	<p>So, eventually it was time to start getting ready. After a bit of a nervous wait, the photographer turned up to have a quick chat before he went and set up. Then the priest, who doesn&#8217;t speak a word of english, arrived at our chalet to say hello. He left, and we followed off to the ice church a few minutes later.</p>


	<p>As we walked to the church, there were lots of people stopping and staring at us, taking photos, with one couple even asking if they could watch the ceremony. We told them they could, but they would have to wait until the very end until they left &#8230; something they weren&#8217;t too keen on.</p>


	<p>We got to the church, and from then on it was pretty much a normal wedding. Apart from the fact it was in a church made entirely of ice, it was -9C and that the ceremony was in Swedish. We did attempt to sing the hymn in Swedish, but of course, not knowing the melody and not knowing how to pronounce any of the words it was a little difficult.</p>


	<p>We had a translator for the ceremony, which was good, because otherwise we wouldn&#8217;t have had a clue what was going on. And it was also handy having another person there to help with the singing.</p>


	<p>The ceremony lasted for about 15 minutes, after which we had about an hour with the photographer, taking shots in the church, under the ice chandelier, and in the Absolut Ice Bar. We had a couple of &#8220;colourful&#8221; drinks for some photos, and then it was all over. We came back to the chalet to warm up a bit before dinner at the restaurant.</p>


	<p>I had been nursing a flu all day, and it was about now that it decided to hit with a vengeance. It could have had something to do with the fact that I was wearing a thin summer suit in sub zero temperatures but I just don&#8217;t know. And Caren, being Caren, was pretty tired. So neither of us really felt too up to going to the restaurant. But we did.</p>


	<p>It was pretty good, however, the pricing is just ridiculous. I know I harp on about it a bit, but I paid about $50 for a small bit of reindeer (which was very nice, but still) and Caren had a $40 piece of salmon. We&#8217;ve worked out that if you want to have a really good holiday in Sweden, you&#8217;d need about $1000 a day for food and accommodation. Unfortunately, our budget doesn&#8217;t run quite that high.</p>


	<p>Due to the aforementioned flu and tiredness, we had a quick main, and then it was off to bed. Husky rides tomorrow!</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a horrid nights sleep, due to this flu that I had, we both decided that we couldn&#8217;t face sleeping in the ice hotel tonight, and would far prefer to stay in our cosy little chalet. It&#8217;s not the cold so much, but the fact that because the hotel is open to the public during the day, you can&#8217;t go to your room until about 7 o&#8217;clock, which means you&#8217;re stuck walking around for about 8 hours after checking out of the chalet. And of course, a cold snap hit today, and it&#8217;s -10C. Not the weather for walking around with a flu.</p>


	<p>Flu or no flu, however, very little was going to be keeping us away from the husky rides. We had seen them taking off over the past couple of days and so we were quite keen to have a go ourselves. We got down to the river pretty early, so we could watch them harnessing up. The dogs are transported in these little cages, and are taken out one by one and hooked up to the sled. The whole time they are barking and jumping around like crazy because all they want to do is run, and they can&#8217;t handle the wait. Erik, our heavily bearded guide, said that once they are all hooked up, you have to go pretty quickly because if they aren&#8217;t running, they start taking it out on the other dog next to them in the line.</p>


	<p>So we climbed on, and off we went in a flurry of ice, dog crap and snow. Because they are working dogs, they are quite adept at running along at 20Kph and going to the toilet. Thankfully Caren and I were at the back of the sled for the first stage, so it was an english couple in front of us who bore the bulk of the assault. (And because they are fed 1 kilo of meat and dried fruits a day, it&#8217;s not a pretty sight.)</p>


	<p>But apart from that, it was one of the best things that we&#8217;ve done. The dogs are just so happy to be running, that nothing else is an issue for them. If we stop, they just want to start again. Apparently they can pull 1000Kg for 60-80 kilometres a day. So they are pretty fit dogs.</p>


	<p>Even though it was -10C, Erik said that it was probably too warm for them today. They have a really thick coat, with multiple layers, and prefer running in -40C to -20C. As they are running along, they occasionally bend down and grab a mouthful of snow .. kind of like a drink on the run.</p>


	<p>We stopped for a coffee and some cake at a camp on the lake shore and all of the dogs started rolling around in the snow, just to cool down a little. We sat and had a chat to our guides about the dogs. They obviously love the dogs, but they are working animals, so they need to treat them accordingly, and never forget the basis of the relationship. Still, the dogs are well looked after, and get to run to their hearts content.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Receptions</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a days travelling from Stockholm to London to Philadelphia, we woke in Caren&#8217;s sister, Carol&#8217;s house. A magnificent 100 year old stone house, with more than enough rooms for the five children who normally live here. Of course, the entire Deem clan was here for what we had thought was a small family dinner, but what turned into a full on reception.</p>


	<p>We spent last night showing photos to everyone and trying to explain cricket to bemused onlookers (though it must be said that Aussie Rules and Rugby Union garnered more interest &#8230; something about fit men running into each other must be universal!). Then, this morning we went of to Jimmy&#8217;s (one of Carol and Marc&#8217;s kids) ice hockey practice for a couple of hours. Very entertaining. It was for 10-12 year olds, but of course there is quite a big size difference in those ages, so some of the bigger kids were having a great time thumping into the little kids. Jimmy did a great job in defence, and stood up admirably to some larger kids. It was a lot easier to follow than the professional games, mainly because we could actually see the puck.</p>


	<p>After getting back and warming up, we had to get ready for the photographer, who was there not only to photograph us, but to mark the occasion of a complete family reunion. Several changes of clothes later (into wedding outfits &#8230; out of wedding outfits &#8230; back into them for more shots) that was all done, and it was onto the reception.</p>


	<p>We had been banned from the dining room for the day, and when the curtains were finally opened a magnificently decorated room, a table set for 16, white roses all around and a two tier wedding cake was there to greet us. Far more than we had ever imagined, it was a little overwhelming seeing the trouble that everyone had gone to. Having had a wedding in a hotel in sweden that was organised by someone else, and to then come to a reception in which all the work had been done by someone else, it was kind of like we were getting it easy. Which of course, we were.</p>


	<p>The reception followed a fairly familiar format, with only minor differences to Australia. Not so big on speeches, and a tradition with little bells. (When someone rings the bell, the bride and groom have to kiss &#8230; which sounds lovely, but it gets a little tedious when the seven to ten year olds in the room keep ringing the bell constantly.</p>


	<p>Many courses of magnificent food, perfectly matched with some great wines, followed: Prawn (Shrimp) Cocktail, Mushroom Soup, Poached Pear and Walnut Salad, Beef Fillet, Cheeses (including the orange American Cheddar &#8230; 64 slices of american cheese &#8230; mmmmmmm) and then the wedding cake for dessert. The wedding cake was a sponge cake. Apparently fruit cakes aren&#8217;t de rigeur, and are a bit of a jokey novelty at christmas time.</p>


	<p>All in all a marvellous day, and our grateful thanks to Mary (Caren&#8217;s mom), Carol and Kathy (Caren&#8217;s other sister) for the work and effort they put in. Also thanks to Marc and Greg &#8230; (and to Beth&#8217;s boyfriend for helping cart the tables in, which I&#8217;m told where quite awkward and heavy.)</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is kind of an amalgamation of days for this entry, because we&#8217;ve done some stuff, but have also done an enormous amount of sitting around, drinking tea and coffee and eating food cooked by other people. Pretty much what you&#8217;re supposed to do on holiday.</p>


	<p>The main thing that we&#8217;ve done is to go to New York on Tuesday (4th March). We caught the local commuter trains (the suburbs of Philadelphia and outlying regions of New York and New Jersey almost run into each other) for about $40 each. About 2.5 hours each way, but a lot cheaper than the express which is about $120 each one way.</p>


	<p>So we got into New York around 9:30, walked up the stairs from Penn Station, and, just as the last time we were here, were overwhelmed by the sheer size of the place. Buildings buildings and more buildings everywhere. Along with thousands of people, all zipping around doing whatever they have to do. Rather than stand there gawking saying &#8220;I&#8217;m a tourist, come mug me,&#8221; we set off immediately, not really sure where we were headed, just sure that movement was necessary. We eventually got our bearings and headed north along 5th Avenue. Not long after this Caren says &#8220;Is that the Empire State?&#8221; At which I look up and go &#8220;Yep&#8221;.</p>


	<p>We weren&#8217;t expecting it, but New York was actually the coldest we have been on the whole trip. There was a firm breeze, which was stunningly cold and went right through our clothes. Fortunately, the sun came out and started to have an effect. So by the end of the day we were actually quite comfortable.</p>


	<p>We set out for the Guggenheim Museum, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. A swirling corkscrew like building it is truly spectacular. We went into the foyer and had a look up, and then set out again. Six hours in New York. Plenty to see.</p>


	<p>A short walk through Central Park (very cold and desolate looking, with very little greenery ) and we found ourselves at the New York Museum. Another quick trip into the lobby, which was huge and spectacular, of course) and we were back on our way. We walked through the streets around here, looking at the marvellous buildings, and dreaming of the prospect of owning an apartment here. Average price for a 2 bedroom apartment &#8230; $1.6 million australian!!!!</p>


	<p>We popped over to the United Nations, stopping along the way at one of the ubiquitous Starbucks &#8230; meh &#8230; but it didn&#8217;t look like anything was happening. No flags, and some crappy little protest about something. We were getting hungy by this stage so we hopped on the subway and headed into Little Italy.</p>


	<p>Just like it is in the movies, lots of cobbled streets, more restaurants and pizza parlours than you could shake a sausage at. We had read about one pizza shop in particular. The place credited with developing the New York Pizza style and the oldest pizza shop in Manhattan. And man, what a pizza. Huuuuuuugggge (about 18-20 inches across), with real mozzerella and marvellous italian sausage. Yum. And some good italian beer to go with it.</p>


	<p>Suitably sated, we set off, just wandering aimlessly, going through neighbourhoods we read about, Soho, Tribeca, Greenwich Village etc etc. All the while we were going &#8220;We could live here. It wouldn&#8217;t be so hard.&#8221; But of course, visiting somewhere with money to spend and eating in restaurants is quite different to living and paying bills and coping with enormous rents and shoebox apartments.</p>


	<p>After wandering around for quite a while, it was time to hop back on the train, and away we went. Back to Philly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After mooching off Carol and Marc for almost a week, we decided that it was about time we did something. So, I decided to cook Kangaroo. After reassuring some horrified children that it was quite ok and that they wouldn&#8217;t die, I managed to find a butcher on the web that said that they sold it (along with Turtle .. I have the address if anyone is interested.) Carol said that it was in the Market District, and that we could do some more shopping in the area. That sounded pretty damn good to me, so off we went.</p>


	<p>A short detour so I could meet up with a client (business trip expenses anyone?) and a trip though a less than salubrious neighbourhood, and then we were in a traditional italian american area. Think &#8220;The Godfather&#8221;, with the fruit stalls and everyone who knows everyone else. About 15 butchers, all specialising in different meats, pasta shops, spice stores, fruit carts etc.</p>


	<p>After wandering for a while we went to the butcher to get the kangaroo, but as you would no doubt guess, they didn&#8217;t have any. It probably would have behoven me to make a quick phone call, but what are you going to do? So, it was going to be beef, but I wouldn&#8217;t tell anyone.</p>


	<p>We left the markets, and back to the house. Many hours cooking, and then we all sat down. There were a couple of apprehensive faces, and a little picking at the food, until Sarah said &#8220;This tastes like beef!&#8221; and so the game was up.</p>


	<p>Next time I will bring my own supply of roo.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>On a Budapest Bound Train</title>
		<link>http://jordanbrock.com/2003/03/08/on-a-budapest-bound-train/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m currently sitting in a cabin on a train bound for Budapest. I&#8217;ve just been woken up by Hungarian Border Police, and had my passport stamped. First stamps in 3 weeks. Caren&#8217;s had a heap from all over the place, but no one seems to want to stamp mine.</p>


	<p>There&#8217;s a couple of days to catch up, so I&#8217;ll quickly go through what&#8217;s been happening.</p>


	<p>We left Carol and Marks house yesterday, after a fantastic week. After the flurry of activity on the first day, we didn&#8217;t do a great deal, other than go to New York. But that was actually just what we wanted. Very relaxing. So it was with a very heavy heart that we got onto the plane to London two nights ago.</p>


	<p>A relatively horrid flight (smooth, but think of close encounters with a paper bag and you know what I mean), and an hour long bus ride to cover 3 Kms to the hotel, and we found ourselves in London. Rather than succumb to the sleep we craved, we decided to catch the train into Central London and have a bit of a poke around. The weather, was fairly typical for London. Grey skies, but not menacing.</p>


	<p>Expecting the train to cost in the region of a car payment, we were pleasantly surprised to find that it was less than a fiver each. After about 45 minutes on the train we got to Piccadily Circus. We walked up the stairs from the Tube station and wouldn&#8217;t you know it, pouring down with rain.</p>


	<p>Because I effectively hadn&#8217;t eaten for about 20 hours, we sought refuge in a Burger King, along with heaps of other people. One devoured lunch later we walked out, only to find that the rain had got heavier. We worked our way through the wet crowds of French tourists, found a bookstore and wasted an hour in there. We decided that we would go back to the hotel because the rain was too heavy.</p>


	<p>On our way, it finally slowed up, so we went for a short walk to see if it would get better. Which it did, turning into quite a magnificent late afternoon, blue skies, bright crowds. So we got a chance to walk around, oohing and aahing appropriately, deciding that it was pretty good, but there is no way that we would want to live in London, unlike when we planned out our lives walking around Manhattan.</p>


	<p>Back at the hotel we had another forgettable meal watching India beat Kenya (and that bastard Ganguly got a ton! Bah!) and had an early night before another big day&#8217;s travel.</p>


	<p>A quick flight this morning and we were in Prague. The plan had originally been to spend the day in Praha, wandering around and to then catch the night train to Budapest. But neither of us felt up to that, so we got ourselves to the station for the afternoon train, after checking with our Budapest hotel that there was a room available.</p>


	<p>The train was late by over an hour, and waiting on the platform was prety damn cold. So when the train turned up, we were glad to see it. We wandered down to the first class end (nothing but the best for us!), only to find that the carriage doors won&#8217;t open. &#8220;Hmmm.&#8221; We get onto the second class carriage, hoping to be able to walk through, but those doors won&#8217;t open either. A conductor ambles by and says &#8220;They are out of order&#8221;, not really seeming to care about it that much either. We grab a spare cabin in lowly second class (pretty good actually) and settle in for the 7 hour journey.</p>


	<p>I spoke to an american who travels a lot in the area and he said that with Hungarian trains, if you get on one, and it&#8217;s going where you want to go, then count yourself lucky. Don&#8217;t ask questions about why things are missing, or why you can&#8217;t get into the first class carriage. Just sit back and enjoy the ride. Which I have to say has been quite pleasant.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Close to the end of our first day in Budapest, and we&#8217;re a little weary from a lot of walking, just sort of passing time until dinner. It&#8217;s rainy out, and it seems that Budapest shuts down on a Sunday, so we&#8217;ll just eat in the restaurant in the hotel. We ate there last night (I had a magnificent Wild Boar Stew with Gnocchi) and it&#8217;s pretty good. And slightly cheaper than Australian prices, which is a welcome turn of events after the gougind prices in Sweden.</p>


	<p>We got into Budapest at about 9 o&#8217;clock last night and found ourselves pretty much smack in the middle of the city on a Saturday night. Quite busy. We had read in our guidebooks a series of horror stories about taxis being run by the mafia, so we were a little wary. Fortunately, we got an honest driver who was more than helpful, and our trip to the hotel ended up being about a third of the price we had expected. The hotel is very pleasant, if a little worn, but very comfortable.</p>


	<p>I got up early to watch the Formula One, the only problem was the German commentary, which made it a little hard to work out what was going on. But I was happy to see it, germans or no.</p>


	<p>A quick breakfast and off we went on our walking tour. The city is quite smoggy, no doubt a relic of the communist regime, but nothing like Los Angeles or Cape Town. We walked around a corner and saw the Budapest Palace, an imposing series of buildings that really puts other palaces in their place. It&#8217;s huuuuge. And it&#8217;s apparently a lot smaller than it used to be, with lots of damage in World War II and the Communist era (their version of restoration work was to knock buildings down!). It&#8217;s been seriously damaged and repaired 86 times in the last 700 years. So no doubt there are dynasties of workmen who have earned their livelihoods doing nothing than work on the Palace. And a damn good job they&#8217;ve done as well.</p>


	<p>We then headed across the River Danube (not at all blue) into Pest (Budapest is the result of joining two cities divided by the river, Buda and Pest). Quite different from Buda, where our hotel is, a lot of winding streets, with cafes and shops. A little quiet, but that is probably due to the fact that it is Sunday, and apparently no shops open up today.</p>


	<p>Other than walk around, we didn&#8217;t really accomplish a great deal. We had some nice coffees and snacks at various places, walked through the old Jewish Ghetto (where the Jews were confined to during <span class="caps">WWII</span>). We&#8217;re not really sure what we are going to do tomorrow. We will have to study the guidebooks a little. We will probably pop into Vienna for a couple of days on our way back to Prague.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Gilded Churches and Drowning People</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another day, more sore feet.</p>


	<p>Up at a very leisurely 9 AM, an average breakfast buffet in the restaurant downstairs and off we went. One of our guidebooks had a walking tour through what is known as the Vizivaros (Waterfront) area of Buda, an old area that used to be full of fishermen and other people who worked on the river. It was apparently razed in the early 1900&#8217;s for &#8220;sanitary reasons&#8221;, so there&#8217;s not too many of the old buildings left, but a fair few of them remain.</p>


	<p>One of the problems of using guidebooks is that they can be out of date, even if it&#8217;s only a year old. A couple of times we climbed innumerable stairs to look at something to find that it had been knocked down, something had been built in front of it or that it was being renovated. But isn&#8217;t that all part of the fun?</p>


	<p>We had a coffee in a Kafehaz (Coffee House) that is in a building next to a two hundred year old church. Unfortunately, due to the fact that everyone in Budapest seems to do nothing other than smoke nonstop while in restaurants, it was quite difficult to hang around and enjoy the building.</p>


	<p>The church is on the banks of the Danube, which is all very pleasant, except for a small note in the guidebook. Apparently, during the last winter of <span class="caps">WWII</span>, the Nazis threw large groups of Jews, who had been tied together, into the freezing river. Not the nicest thing to do to someone.</p>


	<p>We wandered into Pest (trying every bank along the way to change some travellers cheques &#8230; something they don&#8217;t seem to be too keen to do), and had some lunch. Our guidebooks mentioned a Statue Park on the outskirts of town where they carted all the old communist statues and we thought that it sounded good. We had to hurry to get to the bus stop, and waited under the sign that said &#8220;Bus for Statue Park&#8221;. Nothing came. We wandered off, not really knowing what to do and saw another sign around the corner which also said &#8220;Bus for Statue Park&#8221; with an arrow, pointing away from where we were standing. So, no statue park today.</p>


	<p>St Stephens Basilica was just over the road so we popped in for a quick look. A fairly impressive building on the outside, but a truly magnificent one on the inside. Currently being restored, the main areas of the church had been completed and were truly breathtaking. Gilding, paintings, frescoes, statues. Astounding. Of course, quite sickening when you realise how much money went into the construction of it and not towards helping stricken citizens, but I suppose you can&#8217;t help that.</p>


	<p>We are probably going to go to the parliament building (which puts Westminster to shame) tomorrow, but all of our books have conflicting reports as to when it is actually open. Failing that, it&#8217;s off to look at old communist cronies in stone form (and to probably by a CD &#8220;The Songs of the Workers&#8221;).</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Big Steel Lenin</title>
		<link>http://jordanbrock.com/2003/03/11/big-steel-lenin/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today started with a walk around the Buda Palace and Castle District. There&#8217;s a photo on the site of the Palace, but in reality that&#8217;s only about half of the whole thing. There&#8217;s an entire town next to the Palace, made up of old buildings, churches, museums and fairly ugly buildings that went up during the communist times. It&#8217;s quite a contrast to the huge and magnificent Palace, a collection of buildings on windy cobbled streets that open into a series of town squares.</p>


	<p>The Matthias Church is another example of money being spent on building rather than to support the populace, but at least it looks good. In fact, good is a bit of an understatement. Stupendous and astounding are more apt words. Not as much gold as the Basilica that we visited yesterday, but soaring ceilings with intricate hand painted designs. Huge altars, little chapels off to the side, enormous stained glassed windows depicting various saints being saintly and a few religious souls braving the constant stream of awestruck tourists.</p>


	<p>Just next to the church is the Fishermans Bastion, which is supposedly built where the people from the area we visited yesterday helped defend the palace hundreds of years ago. However, the structure that&#8217;s there now is mainly ornamental, and was never used in battle. Try to imagine an Escher carving brought to life. Stairways, arches within arches, paths crossing over the top of each other. Maybe it was intended to confuse any attackers.</p>


	<p>We then wandered across the Danube into Pest, looking for somewhere to eat. Restaurants are quite cheap in Budapest; slightly cheaper than Australia, but of course if you go to one in a tourist area you run the risk of a bigger than expected bill. Horror stories abound of people eating in restaurants without published prices being presented with bills in the region of US$6000, the waiters backed up by large burly goons to ensure payment. Speaking of waiters, they are a slightly surly bunch here. Fairly decent service, but it&#8217;s rarely with a smile (except for in the restaurant in our hotel) and they can disappear for quite a long time, particularly when you want something.</p>


	<p>Eventually we found one that our guidebook said was moderately expensive, but we&#8217;re not sure how this is because we had a two course lunch with two pints of Czech beer for $17! It was a restaurant built in and on a series of little tunnels under a building. Very atmospheric, complete with non communicative and grumpy waiter. We both had Borscht (Beetroot Soup) and I had some Lamb Dumplings while Caren had that Hungarian staple, Chicken Curry.</p>


	<p>Properly sated (and a little tipsy after finishing of Carens enormous beer), we headed off to Statue Park. In 1990, freed from communism, there was no need to keep the huge statues that had been put up during the regime: Lenin, Stalin, Monuments to Workers Power and Glory etc. Quite a few were destroyed until someone decided that they should at least keep them for histories sake. He stuck them in a park on the outskirts of the city, which has slowly grown into one of the biggest tourist attractions in Budapest. And weird too.</p>


	<p>There&#8217;s something disquieting walking around a park with all of these statues that only 15 years ago signified a strong and powerful regime, that kept people under control and denied them freedoms etc, but are now stuck in a park next to a building supplies depot. Weird. I suppose it would be fitting if there was a fully stocked supermarket or clothes store next to the park, but no doubt that will come.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>More Golden Buildings</title>
		<link>http://jordanbrock.com/2003/03/12/more-golden-buildings/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are sitting (in a first class cabin that we can get into this time) on a train bound for Vienna (no Ultravox singalongs please). The Hungarian countryside is flying along around us, fairly grey and lifeless, just getting ready to burst into springly greenness. I think if we had been two weeks later we would have seen a completely different Europe.</p>


	<p>Yesterday was another day composed mainly of walking around, seeing a few sights and having coffees and lunch. We started off with a brisk walk into Pest, to go on a tour of the parliament building (which is huuuuuuuge.) There is a chain fence around the whole thing, with guards posted everywhere. We eventually got to a gate, and we worked out (without any real help from people or signage) that you had to get permission to go buy a ticket, then come back out and wait for the tour to start, and only one of us was allowed to go into the ticket office. They&#8217;re paranoid about security for some reason. Once we were on the tour, we had two security guards walking around with our tour group, in addition to the guide.</p>


	<p>So, you might think that there are some impressive parliament buildings around the world. I&#8217;ve been in a few. But they all suck badly in comparison to the Hungarian one. It could be a palace. 40 kilos of 24 Karat gold was used for the gilding, and trust me, it&#8217;s everywhere. An astoundingly impressive entry hall/staircase with frescoes, columns, statues and 4 kilometres of red carpet. Really knock you around the head kind of stuff.</p>


	<p>Then we went into the Members Lounge, where they basically get to sit around and stuff. Very plush, more gilt edging, more red carpet, more statues. The next room was the cigar room, where members can sit around talking, smoking cigars. If they have to rush into the house for a vote, then they have numbered cigar holders.</p>


	<p>The actual house itself isn&#8217;t as impressive as the entrance, but still way too austere for someone like little Johnny Howard. It was apparently the first air conditioned building in the world, with a massive pit that they used to fill with ice and pump the air into the building.</p>


	<p>After Parliament we wandered around relatively aimlessly, looking at some shops, but not really finding anything too interesting (or too cheap for that matter.) We have been quite good about not eating fast food on this trip (except for Sweden where it was the cheapest by far), but we succumbed to the Colonel today. Boy, was that the mistake of a lifetime. The worst, and I mean worst Zinger burger you could ever hope for. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the bread had been made, near Chernobyl, in the time of Stalin. As soon as I touched it, it started to disintegrate. Serves us right I suppose. The chips were good but.</p>


	<p>One thing about Hungarians, and in particular Hungarians in restaurants is the amount they smoke. Crazy. Non-stop. I know the frech have a reputation for burning it up big, but they are cigarette wimps in comparison. And they have non-smoking sections in restaurants, but it&#8217;s generally only 2 tables in the corner of the room, surrounded by smoking tables, so it doesnt make a lick of difference.</p>


	<p>We wandered up to the Palace to have a look around the History Museum, because we had picked up tidbits about Hungarian History, but wanted to try and work out a cohesive idea of what had happened to the place. Well, let me tell you that the history museum is not the place to go to do this. Wonderful exhibits, lots of information, but we came away far more confused than when we went in.</p>


	<p>As far as we can tell, Hungarian history is basically a litany of people coming in and either taking control of the Budapest or destroying it totally. There must be about 10 instances in the past 1000 years of a complete devastation of the city, followed by a frenzied period of rebuilding. And a succession of revolutions, some successful, some short lived and some failed. There&#8217;s been 3 revolutionary wars that we can work out, but possibly more.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s a great city, and will probably be great to come back to in 10 years or so when they&#8217;ve had a chance to sort out a few things (public transport tickets for example &#8230; you need different tickets for buses, trains, trams etc and you can&#8217;t buy any of them from on the bus. You need to go to a newsagent!), but once they&#8217;ve done that, it will be truly magnificent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Weiner Schnitzels and Beer</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two fantastic, if very wind chilled and slightly expensive days in Vienna. After five days in Budapest, it was something of a relief to find ourselves in a city that, barring the language, at least resembled a western city (good shops, lots of advertising to make you feel at home etc etc). But as far as the appearance of the city goes, very little prepares you for Vienna.</p>


	<p>After the massive buildings in Budapest, we thought that seen a fair bit, but man, they know how to build things big in Vienna. We arrived in town around lunchtime and walked into the centre of town, and area defined by a ring road where the city walls used to stand. And every corner was dominated by a humungous imperial looking building. Museums, opera houses, castles, palaces, parliament buildings, libraries, the lot. Astoundingly impressive. And worthy of spending many hours admiring, except for the fact that it was blisteringly cold. And snowing.</p>


	<p>Even though we had been above the Artic Circle, and seen more snow than you could want, we had only ever seen some really light, weak attempts at snowing. But Vienna turned it on. Nothing too serious, and nothing really settled on the ground, but it was still quite spectacular. For five minutes at least, then you wished it would all just bugger off and let you walk to the next sight without developing a case of frost bite.</p>


	<p>To escape the cold we went to St Stephans Cathedral, a magnificent gothic church with uneven towers. (There is apparently a good reason why one of the towers is shorter than the other, but do you think we could find it?) Bigger than what I remember Notre Dame, we went up on of the towers for a look around. While Caren was having a panic attack (very high up, very windy, with open steel grating underfoot), I managed to have a look around at Vienna. At least until I froze into a solid block from the wind and had to be brought inside to thaw out.</p>


	<p>The next morning we went out to the Palace where the Austrian Imperial Family lived. And if ever you needed any reason as to why revolutions took place then just come here. (Of course, the Austrians didn&#8217;t have a revolution to get rid of their royal family, they just sat down and signed a treaty. Very civilised and efficient of them.) Opulence is too light a word for this place. Gilding everywhere. 1500 rooms. Huge gardens. Different rooms depending on what time of day it was and what meal you were eating. Truly astounding.</p>


	<p>Of course, knowing how all of the rest of the people in Austria would have been living makes you just that much happier that the system has been replaced. Kind of makes me wish that Lizzie would wake up and smell the coffee.</p>


	<p>We then trammed it back into the city, had a coffee at a wonderful coffee house (with smoke stained walls, chandeliers and green velvet lounges), and went to the State Opera House. It was built in the mid 1800&#8217;s, and was appropriately stunning for the time, but was seriously damaged in <span class="caps">WWII</span>, which meant that about 80% of it has been rebuilt. And because they had no money after the war, they had to skimp a bit. Not that it makes it any less grand, just not quite as much ornate sculpturing and gilt edging.</p>


	<p>After that it was a quick nap back at the hostel, and then off to a pub that allegedly sold beer by the centimeter. Not that we saw any evidence of that. Just a lot of Pint mugs. We had some Austrian and Czech beers, and an enormous Schnitzel for dinner. And then it was back to bed, so that we can get up in time for our train ride to Prague.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A magnificent day in Prague, both weatherwise and travellingwise. It was the first day of our trip that the sun came out with enough strength to make us want to actually sit down and feel the warmth. Of course, we still had our thermal underwear on, and it probably never got above 7 degrees, but it still felt wonderful.</p>


	<p>Prague is a tourist operators dream coming to life. Astounding sights and vistas around every corner, all clumped together in a 4 square kilometre block, so there&#8217;s no real travelling time between them. And then when you get to where you&#8217;re going, wow.</p>


	<p>We arrived on Saturday afternoon from Vienna, and after a few trifling issues with the hotel/guest house we managed to settle in. A quick trip around Prague to get our bearings and it was time for dinner. We stopped in a traditional Czech beer hall, about three rooms each of which sat about 15 people around sparse wooden benches and tables. Then they just start bringing the beer. Budweiser, which is originally a Czech beer, and has no shared characteristics with the American version. The main difference being that this one has taste and appeal. So a couple of downed pints and it was time for dinner. We both decided to give the traditional goulash and potato dumplings a go, mainly because it was only about $4. The goulash was wonderful, but we aren&#8217;t sure if they made a mistake and served us window putty instead of the dumplngs. Whoah. Talk about stick to your ribs. Yikes. So we had to wash that down with more beer.</p>


	<p>Up relatively early this morning, primarily to see some of the sights in the early morning sun, but also to beat the crowds (which are pretty bad now, I dread to think what they will be like in the middle of summer.) We made it to Old Town Square, which is postcard city. A large square, surrounded on all sides by huge churches, town halls, splendid old buildings etc etc. Lots of photos, lots of people taking photos. A quick breakfast and we were off again. This time we crossed the river and headed towards the castle.</p>


	<p>We&#8217;re not sure if this castle is less impressive than some of the other ones that we&#8217;ve seen, or if we are just castled out for the time being, but we were a little jaded as we wandered around. That said, the main cathedral in the castle was absolutely stunning, and definately bigger than Notre Dame. More gothic gargoyles and intricate carvings abound. Also some pretty impressive Stained Glass windows, one of which would have easily had 10 000 pieces of glass in it.</p>


	<p>A quick refreshing nap back at the hotel (after walking up 10 flights of stairs &#8230;. no lift thank you very much) and it was off for dinner. There is a Beer Hall that everyone seems to talk about when they talk about Prague. It was famous 10 years ago when we were hostelling. A huge beer hall (it seats about 1200 people), and the beer used to cost a British penny a pint. There must have been some serious inflation in Czech over the past few years because it now cost about <span class="caps">AUD</span>$3 a pint. But it was still pretty impressive. And intoxicating.</p>


	<p>A couple more days here, and then it&#8217;s onto the planes for the loooong flight home. We are kind of looking forward to it. Living out of a suitcase tends to wear thin after a while, but that is a nice problem to have at the moment. No doubt this time next week we will wish we were back here.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sigh.</p>


	<p>Siiting in the BA lounge in Heathrow Airport, waiting the interminable wait for our flight. We&#8217;ve got 7 hours here (only 4 to go) before our flight to Singapore, before we eventually get to Perth, in about 24 hours from now.</p>


	<p>Prague was magnificent. A truly stunning city. A few downsides though. No doubt because they&#8217;ve only had a market economy for 13 years or so, a few things that you come to expect elsewhere have yet to filter through. Such as friendlyness and efficiency on the behalf of hospitality staff. The number of indifferent or downright exasperating waiters was phenomenal, with one gesticulating that we should sit at the piano if we couldn&#8217;t find a seat anywhere else in one restaurant/bar that we went to. But of course, that is supposed to be part of the charm of the place.</p>


	<p>We didn&#8217;t accomplish too much in the last two days, other than walk around a lot, oohing and aahing appropriately, and sit in a sports bar watching the cricket. A went to a museum on Prague under communism, and as you could probably guess, it wasn&#8217;t too pretty an existence. The size of the secret police, the black market, and the need to earn foreign currency (girls were encouraged to give foreign business men a &#8220;night of lovemaking&#8221; &#8211; for a fee of course.)</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s amazing how your mind starts turning thinking thoughts of home when the end of the trip is nigh. What we&#8217;re going to do this weekend (sleep), what foods we can eat (pepperoni from Torres and lots of real beef), and the omnipresent thoughts on work. Of course, you snap yourself out of that and marvel that you&#8217;ve only paid $1.30 for that pint of beer you&#8217;ve just downed.</p>


	<p>Caren asked me last night what the highlight of the trip had been, and without thinking I said &#8220;The dogsled ride&#8221;, to which her stern reply was &#8220;Mine was the wedding.&#8221; After extricating my foot from my mouth, I hastily reconsidered my reply (but realistically, the dogsled ride was damn cool.)</p>


	<p>Our time in Philadelphia was magnificent thanks to the hospitality of Carol, Marc and family, who made their house ours, and also because of the belated wedding reception put on by the whole family. Thanks to everyone who helped with that wonderful afternoon/night.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ll get around to putting some photos up when we get back into Perth, so that you can have a look at what we&#8217;ve seen, where we&#8217;ve been etc. But for now, it&#8217;s goodnight from me, and goodnight from Caren.</p>]]></content:encoded>

	<p>Of course, I&#8217;ve only tried doing it for about 1 week, so I don&#8217;t think that really counts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This blog has been created by me for two real reasons. Firstly, I wanted to try TypePad out, considering I had heard so much about it. Secondly, Caren and I are going to have our first child in 3 months, and I wanted to have some mechanism of easily creating a blog to mark that occasion. Just like every other bastard on the intramanet.</p>


	<p>So, pretty much the same as everyone else I suppose.</p>


	<p>And I also wanted some way of linking to, and putting information about things that really get my goat, such as human rights issues, poverty, hypocrite politicians and the like. Mainly so that I have some area where all of my links are stored.</p>


	<p>I might also recreate the Tripography blog that I wrote when Caren and I were on our Wedding Jaunt early last year.</p>


	<p>Rock.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m off to Japan! Melanie (my sister for those not in the know) is paying for me to go up there to set up her network. Now that could mean more pain than anything, but it&#8217;s a free trip to Tokyo, and in my experience that&#8217;s not something that rolls along every day.</p>


	<p>With Caren due within 8 weeks, I am slightly apprehensive about going. Obviously I would be heartbroken if she went into labour and I wasn&#8217;t around. But, nothing&#8217;s going to happen.</p>


	<p>This is ostensibly to try out the TypePad QuickPost feature, which no doubt is to try and replicate the &#8220;Blog It&#8221; button from GoogleToolbar. Not bad.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, here I am. Tokyo. Wow.</p>


	<p>A pretty standard flight from Perth overnight, broken only with the captain waking everyone on the plane up to make sure they had their seatbelt on. Nice one. Of course, I was in the middle of a deep sleep, and struggled to return.</p>


	<p>On the approach into Tokyo, Mt Fuji was visible on the horizon, poking up through the clouds. It was quite distant, but still spectacular. The actual approach into Tokyo was quite interesting, with an astonishing amount of golf courses underneath the flight path. It looked as though there were about 20 courses, all up against each other, with immaculately landscaping evident.</p>


	<p>The bus ride from the airport was longer than expected, mainly because the airport is 70kms out of town, which makes me wonder how it can really be associated with Tokyo. Met a guy on the bus who travels the world helping telcos set up mobile phone networks. Relatively interesting, in a fairly nerdly way.</p>


	<p>Once I got into town there was a mad rush through the office (whoah, it&#8217;s cramped!), and then to Melanies apartment, which is set back from the road in what feels like a little village all of it&#8217;s own. Very calming, and easy to forget that there&#8217;s 15 million people on the other side of the wall.</p>


	<p>Didn&#8217;t really accomplish too much today. A quick bike ride around the area, some lunch, some dinner, a nap etc etc and back to the flat. The boys are cool. Little teenagers, with all of the appropriate features.</p>


	<p>That&#8217;s it for day 0.5 of the trip.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, it&#8217;s finally happened, and on only my first full day in Japan. Karaoke!</p>


	<p>But first I must tell you about the magnificent food that I&#8217;ve been eating here. All sorts of different stuff, and all magnificent. A Korean <span class="caps">BBQ</span> for lunch on Wednesday where we cooked our own meat on the hotplate built into the table; Yakitori that night (which is kind of like a Yum Cha, but less reliant on deep fried food, and actually includes vegetables); Noodles and fried rice at a little mum and pop noodlehouse where they could barely contain their glee at my ability to use chopsticks; and a more traditional Japanese meal last night with an array of interesting things, including deep fried chicken knuckles (tastier than they might sound), whole prawns, whole fish and of course, sake.</p>


	<p>Then after the meal (and some beers), off to Karaoke. And as much as I resisted, it&#8217;s actually kind of fun. Though, I chose a song that was way out of my limited range and I sounded like a castrato who was actually being modified.</p>


	<p>The Japanese seem to take it very seriously, and have their own songs that they practice (I presume on their own?) and the put on mini stage shows. Of course, it&#8217;s all liberally lubricated with sake, beer and gin, but it&#8217;s good fun.</p>


	<p>It was my own little Lost in Translation moment. They had &#8220;More Than This&#8221; on the list, but I never got around to singing it. I am, however, as yet to see Scarlett Johanssen smiling at me in an elevator. Something that will disappoint me to the day I die.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A day in the office, doing some of the stuff that I actually came up to Tokyo to do in the first place. The computer company delivered the server today, about 2 hours late, with four (!WTF?) guys coming along for the ride. They brought the box into the office, and then all stood around staring at each other and at me. I wasn&#8217;t sure if I was committing some serious social faux pas, but eventually Habu-san came along and saved us. Apparently they were just waiting for someone to take the initiative and probably would have waited for 20 minutes if someone didn&#8217;t tell them to set it up!</p>


	<p>They had it set up within 5 minutes and then scarpered off to home base. I spent the rest of the day squashed up in the office, trying to setup the japanese version of Windows. I pretty much got there in the end, so it probably went better than I thought. Probably a couple of hours work over the next couple of days.</p>


	<p>After work, I went into Harajuku and Shibuya with Imei-san and Habu-san to have a walk around, some dinner and drinks. Plenty of time gawking at all the buildings, and all the lights. Shibuya is extremely hard to describe: total chaos of people, buildings, cars and light is probably the best way. Times Square after a hard night on the tiles might be another.</p>


	<p>It was quite an effort to find somewhere for dinner, but we eventually found an okonomiyaki restaurant. It&#8217;s a kind of pancake mixed with vegetables and meat and all sorts of stuff, which they cook on the hotplate that&#8217;s in the middle of the table. We had three different kinds, and they were all delicious.</p>


	<p>A couple of beers with dinner on my ownsome, as neither of my companions drank! Which meant I was of course drinking for Australia. Don&#8217;t worry. I did us proud. Mostly.</p>


	<p>Of course, the most interesting thing to do in Shibuya is to just walk around experiencing it. An astounding number of people, all going in seemingly random directions. It could take 1 minute to cross a 20 metre road because of the volume of people. I felt a little like a spawning salmon swimming upstream.</p>


	<p>A fair bit of walking, and looking like a complete tourist snapping pictures of everything, and then we found a little bar that Habu-san had been to before. Of course, if you didn&#8217;t know it was there you&#8217;d have no chance because it was on the fourth floor of a building down a little alleyway up a hill. And then it only had about 8 seats. We walked in, and everyone in the bar had to rearrange themselves so that we could get in. But it was worth it because I had some of the best ginnantonix I&#8217;ve had in a long time (lime, not lemon), and a good translated conversation with the bar staff. Great feel to the place, and an astounding range of whiskey.</p>


	<p>A great night out in chaos.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So Saturday was Shoma&#8217;s (one of my nephews) School Sports Day. Most interesting.</p>


	<p>Unlike most Australian school sports days which tend to be nothing but disorganised tedium, the Japanese school sports day is highly organised tedium sprinkled with moments of sheer craziness.</p>


	<p>Exhibit A: The skipping rope game. All of the students in a particular year, in each of the three factions, are grouped in a line, bookended by 2 larger students with a large skipping rope between them. Then, each team in turn, they play jump rope, but with 25 students each jumping as one! And the team with the most jumps after 3 goes is the winner. Group participation at it&#8217;s best, with the objective apparently to create a feeling that &#8220;being part of the group, and doing things with that group, in the same way is the best that you can do.&#8221; HiveLogic.</p>


	<p>Exhibit B: Each faction lines up, and bends at the waist. Another student clambers on to their backs, and runs along the line. As the kid on top runs over a student, they stand up, run around to the front of the line, and so the line moved forward. The objective being to get to the other end of the ground, and come back. The HiveLogic object probably being to show how working as a team can accomplish things that benefit all. Either that or they&#8217;re just having fun.</p>


	<p>Sunday was Taylor&#8217;s (other nephew) sports day: for the younger kids. Pretty much the same sort of deal, but with different whacked out activities, including a massive group callesthenics and acrobatics display. This day also had some real sports. Running.</p>


	<p>In Australia, it might take 30 minutes to get through 10&#215;100m races. In Japan, it takes less than 3. Before each race is finished, the next lot are in the blocks. As soon as the previous race is finished, the starters gun fires and away they go. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;d heard quite a bit about Harajuku before I went to Japan, about how young Japanese dress up in whacked out costumes and spend the day parading around, but believe me when I say there&#8217;s no preparation for the real thing.</p>


	<p>!http://photos1.flickr.com/178115_e0f9e7646a_t.jpg So what goes on at Haraujuku? I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s some deep thinking psychological analysis of the phenomenon, but I don&#8217;t think it would really explain it. Basically it&#8217;s a collection of young Japanese (I suppose somewhere between 15 and 25 &#8230; it&#8217;s very hard to tell), who dress up as characters from books and movies, dolls, goths, and any number of other things.</p>


	<p>They all congregate on a bridge just around the corner from Harajuku Station, and stand there all day. They willingly stand for hours while people photograph and stare at them. They have their own little groups where they talk about whatever they talk about. The two girls in the pic above were posing with people for at least 4 hours. Quite happily standing there and staring at camera after camera. Looking like little dolls.</p>


	<p>There were probably more tourists there than actual &#8220;exhibits&#8221;, but they just seemed to wander around, a little bewildered by the experience. A whole lot of head scratching going on.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>So Damn Cool</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/">This</a> is possibly one of the coolest things that I have ever seen! (In a totally nerdly manner of course. I mean, how else could you get excited about wireless plug.)</p>


	<p>Basically it&#8217;s a souped up wireless access point. It has the ability to extend your own wireless network, or act as a very limited one of it&#8217;s own. That&#8217;s pretty cool on it&#8217;s own, but there&#8217;s so much more.</p>


	<p>It has a <span class="caps">USB</span> port, so if you plug a printer into it, you&#8217;ve got an instant network printer.</p>


	<p>But the coolest thing (in my view) is the audio functionality. You plug it into your stereo, and then you have wireless audio streaming. Bingo. Using iTunes 4.6 on your computer, you target a particular speaker/audio output, and then iTunes will stream your music to your stereo. Sweet. No more cables, plugs, patches. No more crap.</p>


	<p>And the coolest suggestion that I&#8217;ve seen (from Todd Dominey) is for a wireless iPod, where as you walk into your house, you switch the audio output on the iPod and Bam!, it&#8217;s playing on your stereo. No plugging in. Just working.</p>


	<p>Of course, all of this depends on whether or not the product actually works. And considering I don&#8217;t know anyone who actually uses it, this could be all a load of conjecture.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No doubt this is something that every expectant parent experiences (way to overload on the letter &#8216;x&#8217;), but it&#8217;s quite amazing how my thoughts have been changing over the past couple of months. Considerably less concern with gadgetry, clothes etc (still addicted to music and movies), and more about families, building families, preserving existing relationships and thinking more about how everything we are going through has been gone through countless times before.</p>


	<p>So, it was quite coincidental that when Caren and I were out to dinner with Mum, Michael and Cynthia last night, they should start to talk about some of their experiences as children. The short little stories created a picture of a vastly different world and existence to the one that I grew up in, and the one that our child(ren) will grow up with.</p>


	<p>&#8220;Give us an example, SuperChimp&#8221; I hear you cry.</p>


	<p>Well, Michael mentioned how he could remember being out in the backyard of their semi-detached house in Watford with Grandy during World War II. He said that Grandy pointed out a V2 rocket going over their heads, and told him to watch for when the red glow at the tail of the cigar shaped missile went out. If it went out while it was over you, well, then trouble would no doubt ensue. But if it kept going, then you were safe.</p>


	<p>That seemed to ring klaxon-like in my head, combining with the feelings I mentioned above, and a synapse fired, followed by another, and another until an idea formed.</p>


	<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be an horrific shame if we were to lose stories like that one, about how our parents and relatives lived their lives. How could I explain to my child what it would be like to live during a war? Or on a farm in Perth in the 40&#8217;s? We need to get this stuff down on paper.&#8221;</p>


	<p>Then I realised that I don&#8217;t work with paper too well, and that the intramanet is a better medium for this sort of stuff. To this long winded end, I have created a blog, where (I hope), the various members of the various families that have combined to make the Brocks what they are, can go and jot down their anecdotes and rememberences from their childhoods and beyond.</p>


	<p>Ladies and Gentlemen: I am please to present, for your consideration, <a href="http://brockography.blogspot.com/">Brockography</a> .</p>


	<p>P.S. There&#8217;s nothing there yet. But soon. Soon I tells ya!</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two things that leap out from this article:</p>


	<p>Talking about the night he proposed to his girlfriend, Coleen:</p>


	<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d picked it (the ring) up from the jeweller and told her we were going out for a Chinese meal, but we stopped at a BP petrol garage because Coleen had to get the money to pay for the meal.&#8221;</p>


	<p>That&#8217;s right, he&#8217;s a starting player for England, and he makes his girlfriend go get money to pay for dinner, during which he planned to propose to her. Romance = Alive and Well.</p>


	<p>And then this:</p>


	<p>Wayne and Coleen are set to dislodge David Beckham and his pop star wife Victoria as English football&#8217;s first couple after Beckham had a poor tournament and has seen his image tarnished by accusations of extra-marital affairs.</p>


	<p>Yeah right. A chav (albeit a talented chav), with an ugly head, and a Council Flat girlfriend is going to take the place of Beckham and Posh. Uh-huh.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>And so it comes down to this. Inevitable I suppose.</p>


	<p>1.5 weeks to go, which basically means that it&#8217;s due to arrive any damn time it wants to. Caren has packed, the mini nursery (the corner of the bedroom) is almost ready to receive it&#8217;s cargo. Prams are bought. Car seats purchased. Toys are on standby. Nappies are beckoning to be spoiled. The dogs are wondering why we&#8217;re both home all the time. Phones are primed with numbers of relatives. Bills are paid, ready for the long lean times ahead.</p>


	<p>The peanut, which obviously no longer resembles a peanut so much as a sack of kittens within Caren&#8217;s torso, is all set to go. The head&#8217;s in the right spot. The doctor assures us it&#8217;s going to be a normal birth. All limbs are present and accounted for, pushing gently against organs. Just waiting.</p>


	<p>I suppose we are both anxious, pretty much the same as all soon to be new parents. Not sure what&#8217;s going to happen or how we are going to cope. Obviously everything is going to be fine, but still. It&#8217;s just all so new and unknown.</p>


	<p>More news at 11.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Still no freaking baby!</p>


	<p>Which, considering the due date was yesterday, wouldn&#8217;t normally be too much of a problem. Except for the fact that at our ob/gyn appointment last week Dr Smith (his real name, not some name I made up to protect his medical identity for unknown reasons) said that he thought it would be out within a couple of days. So naturally Caren and I got really excited about the prospect of everything appearing in time for the weekend!</p>


	<p>No dice.</p>


	<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s not really a problem. Caren is getting sick of having some feet in her lungs and being short of breath even while lying in bed, but there&#8217;s not really a great deal that can be done. If the wriggler doesn&#8217;t appear by next tuesday it will be induced. So, we&#8217;ll be knee deep in screams and babyshit within a week.</p>


	<p>Joy!</p>]]></content:encoded>

	<p>We&#8217;re off to have a baby. It didn&#8217;t want to come out on it&#8217;s own accord, so we&#8217;re off to force the issue. It&#8217;s a birth canal showdown at the ok corral (or Mercy Hospital, whichever has the best facilities.)</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While discussing our trials regarding Thai food and Evelyn with Phil, the all-encompassing powerlord of M3 Design, I wondered the following:</p>


	<p>What would happen if a couple raising a newborn in Thailand/India/Mexico (or any country with a predominantly spicey cuisine) ate some bland english/western food? Would a plate of Mashed Potatoes cause the infant to rebel against the blandness of the mothers milk? Would the lack of spice, zest and zing in the milk result in an upset baby stomach? We have a right to know!</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today is the <a href="http://www.chinapage.com/newyear.html">Chinese New Year</a>  (Year of the Rooster I believe). Currently there are drums beating in the distance, with constant volleys of firecrackers being let off.</p>


	<p>It reminds me of the first year we moved to Northbridge. We had moved in in the last week of January, and found the area to be quite peaceful, despite its proximity to the hubbub of Northbridge.</p>


	<p>Then one night, we were woken by what sounded like the end of the world happening in our street. Not really sure what was going on, I wandered out to see what was going on. At the end of the street people were setting of barrage after barrage of firecrackers, which was really cool, but it did make us wonder what we had moved into.</p>


	<p>Of course, it soon became evident of what was happening, and it showed us how big a part of the community the south east asian community was. And it led to us learning quite a bit about the area.</p>


	<p>Now, every year when we see the posters go up for the New Year, we know what&#8217;s coming.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="float:right"><img src="http://www.flickr.com/photos/217042_m.jpg" alt="" /> I&#8217;m trying to resist the tempation to turn this whole blog into one long post about Evelyn, but you know, it&#8217;s really hard!</p>


	<p>Especially when you get photos as cute as this one!</p>


	<p>But for the 0.1 people of you actually reading this there has been other stuff occurring. Life does continue. Work does need to be looked at, well, glanced at at least. Some of this stuff will be written about, but in the meantime there&#8217;s one thing I want you all to do.</p>


	<p>And that&#8217;s join <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> . It&#8217;s a free(!) online photo sharing service, and it&#8217;s just fantastic. My username is Mr Sparkle. Add me to your contacts list.</p>


	<p>And then while you&#8217;re at it, sign up for an account (free as well) at <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">BlogLines</a> and at <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, it&#8217;s relatively hard to believe but Evelyn is one month old today! When you have a child some form of temporal distortion kicks in because it seems like she&#8217;s been here forever, but at the same time it feels like only a few days ago that we brought her home from the hospital (and made the mistake of eating Thai!).</p>


	<p>Taking all things into consideration, it&#8217;s been a relatively uneventful month. Evelyn is a fantastic little girl, solidly going about her business of growing. Caren has been doing an astonishing job of feeding her, while I try to do whatever I can do to help. Of course, that generally comes down to all the other stuff that needs to be done (work for money for food being of major import).</p>


	<p>We went out for our first family outing the other night, to a bbq at Smirka&#8217;s house and then to indoor cricket. While it definitely took a lot longer with Evelyn than without her, it wasn&#8217;t too much of a trauma. Just a matter of making sure we had everything, and then hoping that nothing goes horribly wrong. She didn&#8217;t sleep particularly well while out and about, but mainly just sat there.</p>


	<p>One of the best things of having a child, and I&#8217;m sure this has been said over and over again by new parents everywhere, is watching them discover the world. Obviously Evelyn&#8217;s world ends somewhere about 2 feet from her face at the moment, but it&#8217;s still great. Every now and then she gets distracted by her hand, as it waves around. She doesn&#8217;t know what it is, but it sure looks interesting!</p>


	<p>One month down. 17 years and 11 months to go!</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While acknowledging that I have been woefully incompetent at maintaining this blog with any form of regularity, I shall continue as though nothing has happened. Because really, not a great deal has. As with any new parent, my life has consisted primarily of helping Caren to keep Evelyn alive and growing, working, sleeping and doing my best to maintain some form of mental well being.</p>


	<p>And how am I going in my attempts? Well, better in some than others, but in the important ones (eg keeping Evelyn and Caren alive) I&#8217;m doing quite well indeed.</p>


	<p>Other than that, this post is ostensibly a method of testing a new feature that <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">FeedBurner</a> have added. That of autodetecting appropriate <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">amazon</a> content based on the drivel that I write in here. So, I shall just mention a couple of albums that I have been listening to recently, and we&#8217;ll see what comes up!</p>


	<p>This week I &#8216;ave been mostly listening to Eskimoe Joe &#8211; &#8220;A Song Is A City&#8221; and Finn Brothers &#8211; &#8220;Everyone is Here&#8221;</p>


	<p>Next, I&#8217;ll post something about some films that I own and we can see what happens then!</p>


	<p>(Oh, and if you&#8217;re wondering what the hell Feedburner is, then, follow the link and we can try and work it out together.)</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/markets/bonds/2004/11/22/1122automarketscan02.html">study was released</a> today that found that 6% of Macintosh users were Wintel users who had bought their Mac after they bought an iPod. Which of course everyone is taking to mean that the iPod is attracting people to Apples.</p>


	<p>Which, while true for some, takes away from the bitchin&#8217; ass coolness of the new <a href="http://www.apple.com.au/imac/">iMac</a>, and the funky mofo sexiness of <a href="http://www.apple.com.au/macosx/">MacOSX Panther</a></p>


	<p>Of course, I&#8217;m still using my PC for just about everything I do. Except Skype.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Stockholm Looks Different</title>
		<link>http://jordanbrock.com/2004/11/27/stockholm-looks-different/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="float:right"><img src="http://www.flickr.com/photos/1727791_245e753ffc_m.jpg" alt="" /> When we stayed in Stockholm, we got off the train from the airport at a train station about 400 metres to the right of this picture, on the bridge. We then decided to save money and walk to our hotel, which was in that red boat in the lower right hand corner of the photo.</p>


	<p>Not such a bad thing you say. Except for the fact that it was snowing, there was ice all along the footpath and that it was below 0C. The wheels on the suitcase jammed with ice and grit from the road, rendering them completely useless. I was carrying a laptop and a suitbag (with Caren&#8217;s wedding dress and my suit), and 2 suitcases, while Caren was struggling with all the remaining crap that we decided (for some completely unknown reason) we needed to lug all the way around the world.</p>


	<p>So, when I saw this photo in the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=sweden&#38;format=rss_200">Sweden <span class="caps">RSS</span></a> feed on <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">BlogLines</a> it brought back all sorts of weird memories. Happy memories for the trip and wedding and bad memories for the trudging and the carting and the snowing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

	<p>Of course, returning home to get involved in the middle of a domestic violence dispute with our non-english speaking neighbours made for a slightly stressful and non-relaxing late afternoon. We think all is relatively well now that tempers have dropped.</p>]]></content:encoded>

	<p>Of course, while sitting look at the sea thoughts obviously turn to the tsunami, and just how impossible it is to imagine the ocean rising continuously until it consumes everything. Something to be thankful for I suppose. But obviously, we have to do what we can (in other words &#8230; <a href="https://www.redcross.org.au/Donations/onlineTsunamiDonations.asp">donate cash now!</a> )</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With some of the best coverage of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_Earthquake">Tsunami Disaster on the internet</a>, WikiPedia is showing off it&#8217;s chops. A community managed encylopedia, it shows the wonders of open source content development. People submit articles, which can be edited by anyone who cares to, which creates a continually checked, living encyclopedia. And with stories such as the unfolding crisis in South-East Asia, it really comes into it&#8217;s own. An authoritative resource on just about everything.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Wednesday (12th Jan), the <span class="caps">WACA</span> hosted the <a href="http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2004-05/AUS_LOCAL/OTHERS/WA_VIC_12JAN2005.html">first interstate Twenty20 cricket match</a>. And it was truly astounding. 20,000 people showed up, surprising the organisers somewhat, as they had to let people actually sit on the grass and let the public into the members area. What a corker of a match!</p>


	<p>Of course, it would have been better if Victoria could have scraped together some more runs, but when WA came into bat all was forgotten, as Ronchi and Campbell went on a major offensive. Magnificent!</p>


	<p>With the success of the match the following day between <a href="http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2004-05/PAK_IN_AUS/SCORECARDS/PAK_AUS-A_13JAN2005.html">Australia A and Pakistan</a>, there is a lot of talk (maybe, maybe too much talk) about the place of Twenty20 cricket, and where it can fit in with the other series. My thought it that it should just replace one day cricket altogether.</p>


	<p>If one day cricket was devised to give people a game with plenty of excitement and almost guarantee that there will be a result, then it has been surpassed. The typical <span class="caps">ODI</span> is now a predictable affair: 15 overs attempting to score at 6 an over, 25 overs scoring at 4 &#8211; 6 without losing too many wickets, and then raise the tempo at the end. So, cut out the stuff in the middle and you&#8217;re left with Twenty20. And it has the advantage of being over in 3.5 hours, which makes everyone happy; players, broadcasters and the public who can come to the match after work and be home by 10.</p>


	<p>Of course, the World Cup is the one  snag in this scenario, as it would be a shame to see that change or disappear. But on the whole, bring on the tonk!</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you were watching the news coverage of the Golden Globes on TV this morning (and to some <a href="http://entertainment.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,4459,11970995%255E10431%255E%255Enbv,00.html">extent online</a>), you&#8217;d be forgiven for thinking that because Nicole and Cate didn&#8217;t win the Golden Globes that the Hollywood Foreign Press had decided not to award them to anyone.</p>


	<p>Now, I realise that any country&#8217;s press is likely to focus on people from that country, but surely some recognition of the actual winners is warranted? Kind of like the 1992 Olympics coverage on <span class="caps">NBC</span> in the <span class="caps">USA</span>. I remember a swimming race where an american came in second. All well and good, but during the medal presentation, they didn&#8217;t even mention the name of the gold medallist, or in fact show them on TV. The camera just zoomed in on the silver medallist and ignored all of those nasty foreigners.</p>


	<p>Of course, the nadir of this type of reporting was seen during the Tsunami crisis. &#8220;150,000 dead in tsunami, including 9 Australians.&#8221; Ooooh, how tragic for us.</p>]]></content:encoded>

	<p>Yes, that&#8217;s right. You can find out the actual locations of taxis on the streets of Chicago. So you can work out what&#8217;s the best time to walk out your front door to hail a cab.</p>


	<p>Which is all very well and good, but if they had some way of seeing if someone else was about to hail that cab &#8230; maybe that&#8217;s why they bought <a href="http://www.keyhole.com">this</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One thing that I can&#8217;t stand is being late, and I start to get all <span class="caps">OCD</span> about things when I am running late. Tonight, I was supposed to meet up with Habu-san and Kobayashi-san at the Brass Monkey, but due to missed phone calls, I ended up being an hour late. Totally my own fault, and I felt terrible about it.</p>


	<p>Nonetheless, when I finally got there, they were really gracious about everything, and then we wandered off to dinner. I had originally planned to go to the Viet Hoa, but we ended up at the Dusit Thai. I hadn&#8217;t been there for years (Jen, James and I found ourselves there one night after some solid after work drinking). The food was pretty good, nothing too spectacular. Slightly overpriced &#8230; it probably would have been better to get to the Viet Hoa.</p>


	<p>It was good to see Habu again, and to hear a little about Koba-san&#8217;s two boys (who seem to be little bundles of energy), through the translation of Habu. A very stilted conversation. Makes me want to get back to Tokyo as soon as I can.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A quick trip to the cinema tonight for some <a href="http://www.hanscafe.com.au/">Hans Cafe</a> goodness (mmm, Squid Pepper Rice, my old friend) and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372784/">Batman Begins</a>. Rather good I must say.</p>


	<p>Not that I was worried, but it was good to see that the approach of the last 2 Batman films, directed by (<em>shudder</em>) Joel Schumacher, hadn&#8217;t been continued, and the story was actually treated with some respect.</p>


	<p>While obviously set in a different reality, there was a concerted effort to explain</p>


	<ul>
	<li><strong>a)</strong> why there is a guy flying around in a batsuit fighting crime, and </li>
		<li><strong>b)</strong> how he manages to do what he does. One problem with the earlier films is that there was no real explanation of how this guy got to the mental state that he is in (except <em>&#8220;Oh, his parents died, and he fell into a well with some bats in&#8221;</em>).</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Second to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217869/">Unbreakable</a>, probably the best origin story of a cartoon/superhero character I&#8217;ve seen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

	<p>Sirius is a satellite radio broadcaster in the US, who have launched a Podcasting Channel, that is being edited/run by Adam Curry (host of <a href="http://www.dailysourcecode.com/">The Daily Source Code</a>, one of the original Podcasts that set the ball rolling.</p>


	<p>Apple have announced that they are going to integrate podcasts into iTunes 4.9 when it is released in the upcoming weeks. From what I can gather, this is not really going to be anything more than a simple directory of podcasts, the contents of which are controlled by Apple. They have got the ubiquitous Adam Curry on board, so it&#8217;s unlikely that it will be totally corporate. I do, however, stand to be corrected once the application is actually released.</p>


	<p>Yesterday, I received an invite to create an account with <span class="caps">ODEO</span>, which is an online podcast directory, synchronising agent and a tool that allows you to create your own podcast.</p>


	<p>First impressions of <span class="caps">ODEO</span> are fantastic. Great design, clear and simple user interface, easy navigation. Everything speaks of thought being put into the product. The site simplifies the discovery and downloading of podcasts. I&#8217;ve listened to more casts in the last 24 hours than in the last month or so. Absolutely fantastic!</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This post originally appeared over on <a href="http://www.spintech.com.au">Spin Technologies</a>, but I decided that it was probably more appropriate for this site. So here it is!</em></p><p>Almost a year ago, I started hearing about <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com">BaseCamp</a>, a project management/organisational tool, that had been created by <a href="http://www.37signals.com">37 Signals</a>. As more information started appearing about the product and it&rsquo;s development, people started talking about <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">RubyOnRails</a>, a new &ldquo;framework&rdquo; for web development. Details were relatively sketchy, documentation was around but not for the beginner and most importantly, Rails was only at 0.4 or something similar, so I had a quick peak, and then ducked for cover within the comfortable blanket I had made from <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ASP</span></span>.Net and C#. (Oh, but I signed up for BaseCamp though!)</p><p>And then in December last year, a <a href="http://www.mashobbies.com.au">client</a> that I had developed a site for, using my technology security blanket of course, came to me with an idea for a site (it eventually became <a href="http://www.worldtimecapsule.com">World Time Capsule</a>&#8211; a site where you can store information/documents/whatever and lock them up, for loved ones to view later). There wasn&rsquo;t a lot of money for the project and so I began to think that this might be an opportune time to begin to look at RubyOnRails. I sat down and did a couple of the online tutorials that had appeared around the place (mainly blogging applications, todo lists &#8211; modelled on Tada from the ubiquitous 37 Signals!)</p><p>It quickly became clear that here was a technology that had been lovingly crafted, with amazing skill and forethought. <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com">David Heinemeier Hansson</a> is the creator of the framework. He was initially a contractor for 37 Signals, doing work in <a href="http://www.php.net"><span class="caps">PHP</span></a>, and then when he started work on BaseCamp he decided to create a new method of developing websites. Once BaseCamp was up and running, he extracted RubyOnRails from it, did some polishing up and released it out onto the web.</p><p>It was quickly taken up by developers around the world who were getting tired of the large amounts of work that needed to be done in order to start a project, and were taken by the simplicity of the code. These developers started making suggestions and improvements, working hard to fix bugs and issues that arose, and basically working hard to create a fantastic environment. These efforts continue today, with David recently allowing <a href="http://jamis.jamisbuck.org/">Jamis Buck</a> and Jeremy Kemper to commit changes to the official RonR source tree.</p><p>Bear in mind that all of this development is because the extra nice people at 37 Signals decided that the technology they built when creating BaseCamp would be made available to whomever wanted it, at no charge. Open Source at it&rsquo;s best.</p><p>So how is Spin making use of this great platform/framework? Other than World Time Capsule, this site is built using RubyOnRails, as are several more that we&rsquo;ve done recently: <a href="http://www.globalhealth.com.au">Global Health Source</a>, <a href="http://www.11recruitment.com.au">11 Recruitment</a>, and <a href="http://www.planningyourgetaway.com.au">Planning Your Get Away</a>. We are currently redesigning our company <a href="http://www.spintech.com.au/intranets">Intranet</a> using Rails, building a fully fledged eCommerce site for an up and coming clothing retailer and developing an intranet for <a href="http://www.five-senses.com.au">Five Senses Coffee</a> to help them manage their orders and interaction with their clients.</p><p>I think you could safely say that Spin is now firmly running on Rails. In an upcoming post, I&rsquo;ll look at exactly how Ruby On Rails is used to build a site.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It&#8217;s just astonishing how quickly this has happened, but our little girl is almost 1 year old! No doubt we will soon be saying &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe she&#8217;s leaving high school!&#8221; and &#8220;Wow, she&#8217;s leaving home. Sigh!&#8221;</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, as of yesterday, we have been parents for 1 year. And I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s been said many times before, but wow, what a year. It&#8217;s all been pretty much fantastic, and we have a wonderful little girl.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s so cool to watch her grow and develop. Looking back through the photos from her <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mrsparkle/search/tags:birthday,evelyn/tagmode:all/">monthly birthdays</a> it&#8217;s amazing to see the development that you don&#8217;t notice on a day to day basis.</p>


	<p>What we have noticed day to day recently is a real burst in mini milestones. In the last month she has:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Gone from waking up 3-4 times a night, to sleeping just about the whole way through,</li>
		<li>Started drinking out of her cup,</li>
		<li>Started eating on her own</li>
		<li>Free standing</li>
	</ul>


	<p>All very exciting.</p>


	<p>We&#8217;re off to <a href="http://www.rottnest.wa.gov.au/">Rottnest</a> tomorrow with Caren&#8217;s work. Should be interesting. Hopefully we can obtain healthy supplies of alcohol.</p>


	<p>Oh, I found out today that Dee is in hospital &#8230; nothing too serious from all accounts &#8230; just some bed rest. Paul must be working her too hard.</p>


	<p>&#8220;Get mah dinner woman!&#8221;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently signed up to <a href="http://www.strongspace.com">Strongspace</a>, the latest service from <a href="http://www.textdrive.com">TextDrive</a>, the wonderful people who host all of my RubyOnRails sites.</p>


	<p>Strongspace is essentially an online storage service, with all sorts of added features. You can upload using <span class="caps">SFTP</span>, browse your files using your browser, and unlike other services, you can actually login to your account via ssh. This last part is particularly cool when combined with <a href="http://rsync.samba.org/">rsync</a>.</p>


	<p>rsync is a fantastic utility that performs incremental backups either on your own computer, over your network, or in the case of Strongspace, over the internet. Once you do your initial upload, you just run the script as often as you want, and it will only upload what has changed.</p>


	<p>All in all, some very cool stuff, and when used in concert, it&#8217;s an amazingly powerful system that can ensure that you never lose anything ever again.</p>


	<p>Now if only I can convince myself that I can afford the 30Gib plan, I can back up all of my photos as well!</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Further to my post the other day about <a href="http://www.strongspace.com" title="Strongspace" target="_blank">Strongspace</a>, backups and <a href="http://rsync.samba.org" title="rsync - data sync utility" target="_blank">rsync</a>, I thought I would just write a little bit about how I have everything setup, more for my own records than anything else. If the two other people who venture onto this page would like to read along then open your books to page one, and remember to turn the page when you hear the bell.</p>


	<p>First of all, you need to get yourself a Mac. I&#8217;m serious about that. I&#8217;ve been a PC person all along but things just work better on MacOSX. It&#8217;s true. I know it sounds a little like a reformed smoker, however, you should really give a Mac a go. Get a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/" title="Apple MacMini - Oooh, so sexy!" target="_blank">MacMini</a>. They look sweet.</p>


	<p>In order to connect to Strongspace, you need to have ssh on your computer. This comes standard with MacOSX, but you will have to download it for Windows. The best client that I have found is <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/" title="PuTTY: A free telnet/ssh client" target="_blank">PuTTY</a>. Download it (it&#8217;s free), put it in your windows folder.</p>


	<p>The next application you need is an <span class="caps">FTP</span> client that supports <span class="caps">SFTP</span>. The best (IMHO) windows free client is <a href="http://filezilla.sourceforge.net/" title="FileZilla - Fast, Reliable and Free" target="_blank">FileZillla,</a> and for MacOSX it&#8217;s <a href="http://cyberduck.ch/" target="_blank">Cyberduck</a>.</p>


	<p>Then (and this is the bit that I don&#8217;t know how to replicate on Windows) you have to create some <span class="caps">SSH</span> public keys. We need to do this so that we can make connections to Strongspace without having to type in a password everytime we want to back some files up. There are instructions on how to do this on the <a href="http://www.strongspace.com/weblog/tips-and-tricks/using-ssh-keys-for-a-quick-sftp-login" title="Using SSH Keys for a Quick SFTP Login" target="_blank">Strongspace blog</a>. Essentially you need to create a public key and copy it up to a file called &#8220;authorized_keys&#8221; in a .ssh directory in your user directory on strongspace and then away you go. All very handy.</p>


	<p>The next step is to write and test your rsync script. There are more options for rsync than I could ever learn, and also more functionality than I could write about, so I will just post the script I use. Basically it copies all data within my user directory, excluding directories that are listed in the &#8220;backup_excludes.txt&#8221; file and delete any files from the remote server that have been deleted from the local computer. Simple really:</p>


<pre>#!/bin/sh
rsync -e ssh -azvC --delete --exclude-from backup_excludes.txt \
/Users/userdir/ username@username.strongspace.com:/home/username/

</pre>

	<p>The next step is to add a cron job to your computer. This is where the Mac part becomes pretty essential, because Windows doesn&#8217;t have cron. It does have Task Scheduler, but I haven&#8217;t been able to get that to run particularly reliably. In any case, an entry like the following will run your backup script every hour between the hours of 9AM and 10PM during the day.</p>


<pre>01 9-22 * * * /Users/userdir/backup_documents
</pre>

	<p>Now this might seem like a lot to copy up, but that&#8217;s the beauty of rsync. It only does incremental copying, so it will only copy files that have changed since the last time the script ran. Of course, if you work with video files, this might be overkill, because of the time it takes to upload the files, so you can adjust to your own needs.</p>


	<p>rsync can also do standard weekly incremental backups, which is something I have yet to experiment with.</p>


	<p>Like I said, this was mainly for my own records, but hopefully it will come in handy for someone.</p>


	<p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span></strong>:
While trying to help <a href="http://dave.typepad.com/dave/2005/08/attn_applescrip.html#comments">Dave Caolo</a> it became apparent that I left one step out of the article &#8230; installing <a href="http://www.sshkeychain.org/">SSHKeychain</a>. This freeware program waits on your computer for an <span class="caps">SSH</span> key request, intercepts that request and sends the required information, eliminating the need for you to have to type in your passphrase every time you try to backup your data, or <span class="caps">SFTP</span> into somewhere. It&#8217;s very handy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

I was sitting down with Evelyn this morning, more in an attempt to prevent her from climbing all over the entertainment system shelving than anything else, and while she was holding several pieces of cardboard in her hand, she looked up at me and promptly took three steps. Just like that. Attempts to repeat the feat resulted in one or two steps here and there.
</p>
<p>
Caren and I thought she took one step yesterday morning, but you don&#8217;t know whether its a real step or just stopping herself from falling. But today&#8217;s were legitmate steps. Unfortunately Caren wasn&#8217;t around to see it, but that just means we have plenty of practice to do this afternoon!

After a fairly comprehensive victory in <a href="http://aus.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/2005-06/SUPERS/SCORECARDS/AUS_ICC-XI_SUPERS_ODI2_07OCT2005.html" target="_blank">last night&#8217;s cricket match</a>, Ricky Ponting had this to say:
<quote>
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we had to prove anything to anyone,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We heard some things coming into the tournament that we were a bit vulnerable. We had some points to prove and we&#8217;ve done that.&#8221;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, some relatively major changes have been going on of late. The most significant being that we have finally got around to buying a house! It only took about 10 years of procrastinating and avoiding the whole issue, but we&#8217;ve got there.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s a decent enough brick and tile house on a battleaxe block in Bayswater. Not the best area, but certainly decent enough.</p>


	<p>Obviously the majority of our time of late has been taken up with trying to get things sorted out in the house. Putting stuff in cupboards, moving it all when we realise that it&#8217;s in the wrong spot; drilling countless holes to hang shelves and hooks; organising a never ending stream of tradespeople to come and install airconditioning or rewire the house, or cut down trees or any number of things. Quite exhausting really.</p>


	<p>And all of this while I&#8217;m trying to get enough work done that we can afford to go away on our trip to the US in a couple of weeks. Which in itself is going to be an ordeal &#8230; I mean, do you want to spend 20 odd hours in an airplane with a 15 month old toddler? Regardless of how much you love her?</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s finally here. After what seems like an eternity of waiting, the <a href="http://www.apple.com/au/itunes/">Apple iTunes Music Store</a> is available to Australian residents.</p>


	<p>With various holdups and delays, attributed by many to a record company holding out for extra cash from the deal, the store launched today.</p>


	<p>While I think that the $1.69 per single is overpriced (compare that to AU$1.31 in the <span class="caps">USA</span>), I would have to say that I am extremely happy at the album price. Most albums seem to be $16.99, which is a dramatic improvement on the $30 &#8211; $32 you pay on an album in the store.</p>


	<p>So, <a href="http://www.justinfrench.com/index.php?id=139">like others are saying</a> my credit card had better get ready for some action!</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="caps">GYM</span> (Google, Yahoo and Microsoft) are pulling out all of the stops to create the best service based websites. While we&#8217;ve had web based email for quite a while (<a href="http://www.hotmail.com">Hotmail</a> etc), it took <a href="http://gmail.google.com">gmail</a> to really get the ball rolling.</p>


	<p>Then they launched <a href="http://maps.google.com">gMaps</a>, which microsoft basically copied (and relatively poorly I might add) with their Virtual Earth site. Now, they&#8217;ve really thrown down the gauntlet with <a href="http://local.live.com">Windows Live Local</a>. I haven&#8217;t had much of a play around with it, but they have &#8220;Bird&#8217;s Eye Imagery&#8221;, which is just stunning.</p>


	<p>I mean, do you want to see <a href="http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&#38;cp=40.035558~-75.182957&#38;style=o&#38;lvl=2&#38;scene=1816711&#38;sp=aN.40.035554_-75.183029_Carol%20and%20Marc%27s_">Carol and Marc&#8217;s</a> house?</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day there was a <a href="sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/01/stuck_systems.html">post by Seth Godin</a>  in which he talked about the opportunity for an online bibliography creator that allowed you to just enter the <span class="caps">ISBN</span> for a book, and it would automatically find all of the relevant information for you, incorporate it into a bibliography, which you could then share with whomever you wanted to. I was sort of looking for some project where I could incorporate <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon Web Services</a> and also start using Google AdSense. So this project basically slapped me in the head and said &#8220;Build Me&#8221;.</p>


	<p>The upshot of all of that is that I did. Checkout <a href="http://biblio.spintech.com.au">Biblio &#8211; Online Bibliography Creator</a>. It&#8217;s all very basic at the moment, but you can search for a book, build a bibliography and print it out in 5 different citation styles. There&#8217;s alot of things I need to add to it: Search by Book Name, Manual Citation Entry (for sources not listed on Amazon), other Citation types (articles, web pages, journals etc etc). Still, it&#8217;s a start.</p>


	<p>I built it relatively quickly in <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">RubyOnRails</a>. I have spent most of the past few months pretty much back in the world of <span class="caps">ASP</span>.Net and C# for a couple of projects that I&#8217;m working on &#8211; <a href="http://graddirect.sbdc.com.au">GradDirect</a> (I&#8217;m subcontracting for <a href="http://www.ibc.com.au"><span class="caps">IBC</span></a>) and on a new site for <a href="http://www.kvm.com.au"><span class="caps">KVM</span> Australia</a> which is just about getting ready to launch (man, talking about  WebCentral is a whole new post .. sigh). The upshot of it all was that I had slipped out of the RubyOnRails space, and I had forgotten just how damn cool it is. Good to know that she fits back on like a smooth glove.</p>


	<p>Anyway, check out <a href="http://biblio.spintech.com.au">Biblio</a>. Kick the tyres and leave a comment about what you thought of it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This humble weblog has been having some difficulties of late, particularly concerned with actually being available for the two of you to read. While this probably doesn&#8217;t cause much of a problem for humanity at large, it&#8217;s mostly annoying for me because I get a little email saying &#8220;Yo goober, your boring site is down.&#8221;</p>


	<p>So, in the interests of trying to work out what the hell is going on, I&#8217;ve killed all of the content (except for the wonderful selection of photos and links down the side). If the site manages to stay operational for more than the 45 minutes it did last time I will reload the archives. If it doesn&#8217;t, well it will just fit in with the rest of my day (eg the catastrophic hard drive failure that just happened inside my PC).</p>


	<p>And if it&#8217;s really screwed? Well, I&#8217;m switching to <a href="http://textpattern.com">Textpattern</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000901.html">Intellectual Bargain Shopping, by Jeffrey Veen</a></p>


<blockquote>    
<blockquote>To predict the behavior of ordinary people in advance, you only have to assume that they will always try to escape a disagreeable situation with the smallest possible expenditure of intelligence.     &#8211; Friedrich Nietzsche  </blockquote>

Still, to this day, I am presented with the tired old argument that &#8220;users are stupid&#8221; &#8211; that the hubris of developers and designers somehow trumps investment in usable products.  I love how this quote turns the tables. Users aren&#8217;t stupid, they&#8217;re efficient. They&#8217;re spending the least amount of effort (i.e. intelligence) as they possible can on each step of the goal they&#8217;re trying to achieve. If you make them spend more, they&#8217;ll go somewhere else &#8211; it&#8217;s like intellectual bargain shopping.

		<title>What&#039;s that about the eggs?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an unintentional, but happy set of circumstances I ended up watching a couple of Natalie Portman (OMG <span class="caps">SO HOTT</span>!) movies over the past couple of days: <strong>Closer</strong> and <strong>V For Vendetta</strong>.</p>


	<p>I thought both were excellent films, and that Ms Portman, often criticised for not being the most emotional actress around, was fantastic (an opinion no doubt helped by her aforementioned hottitude).</p>


	<p>I have one question about each film however:</p>


	<p>In V for Vendetta, what&#8217;s the point with the two guys cooking her the same egg breakfast? Is it to symbolise that she&#8217;s a prisoner in both of their houses? Or that both men, though different people, aim to do the same thing, albeit via different methodologies? Or were they in cahoots?</p>


	<p>In Closer, (SPOILER <span class="caps">ALERT</span>), we learn at the end that her name is Jane Jones, the name she said was her real name to Clive Owen&#8217;s character in the strip club, though he wouldn&#8217;t believe her. So, what&#8217;s the point of that? Am I dense? Should I stop watching films completely?</p>]]></content:encoded>

	<p>Just got back from a magnificently relaxing weekend on <a href="http://www.rottnestisland.com/en/default.htm">Rottnest Island</a></p>


	<p>An internet free weekend, which is not such a bad thing every now and then. Had lots of fun with Evelyn and Caren. I even managed to get Caren to ride a bike (something that has only happened <em>4 times</em> in the 14 years we&#8217;ve been together!)</p>


	<p>We stayed in Longreach Bay, and one night I wandered over to Geordie Bay, just in time to watch the sun do this. The only thing that detracted from a wonderful experience was that people on the boat on the left were playing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000032RS/002-0316106-7332005">KC and the Sunshine Band&#8217;s Greatest Hits</a> at an extraordinarily loud volume.</p>]]></content:encoded>

	<p>On the World Cup:</p>


<blockquote>
I also love the way how, after the ball goes out-of-bounds or there is foul, each player involved will stop, stare directly at the referee, and act out the call he wants the official to make. And then the ref goes ahead and makes whatever ruling he was going to issue anyway. It&#8217;s as if every team were made up of the galaxy&#8217;s most ineffectual Jedis.

	<h3>Setting up a subversion project</h3>


Create the trunk, tags and branches subdirectories.
<blockquote>
<pre>
svn import /path/to/project http://server.com/svn/path -m "Initial Upload" 
svn checkout http://server.com/svn/path/trunk project name
</pre>
</blockquote>

Then some general housekeeping for Rails apps and subversion:
<blockquote>
<pre>
svn remove log/*
svn commit -m "Removing Logs" 
svn update
svn propset svn:ignore "*.log" log/
svn commit -m "Ignoring Logfiles" 
</pre>
</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes you wake up with a list of things to do in the day. Things that you need to do. Today my list included such wonderful activities as washing the dogs, getting my eyes tested, washing the car, doing some food shopping and other little chores here and there. Of course, these plans never work out.</p>


	<p>I get back from walking the dogs, have some breakfast, put the dogs into the car to take them to get washed and I notice the front tyre of the car looking a little flat. &#8220;Oh well, I&#8217;d better pump that up at the petrol station&#8221; I think to myself.</p>


	<p>I reverse the car and something is wrong. Of course, the mini supposedly has the wonderful auto flat sensing warning light, so I wonder why that&#8217;s not doing what it was supposed to do. We&#8217;ve got the special run flat tyres that let you drive on them, so it&#8217;s not the biggest problem, but of course, my immediate thoughts are on the $300 it will be to replace the tyre.</p>


	<p>So I head off to Bob Jane to get a new tyre fitted. After some confusion about whether or not they can be repaired, and some other issues about the age of my tyres, it becomes apparent that I need to replace the tyres. All four of them! And what are the <a href="http://opony.netcar.pl/x_C_I__P_115523226-115510002.html">only tyres available?</a></p>


	<p>For $1400!</p>


	<p>Sigh!</p>


	<p>So we end the day about 1 house repayment behind where we started. Totally unplanned of course.</p>]]></content:encoded>

	<p>When I went to have my eyes tested (you know, the usual &#8230; sore eyes, headaches, unable to concentrate) I asked if using computers non-stop would have caused any damage. &#8220;No, it&#8217;s your parents&#8217; fault!&#8221; Good to know that it&#8217;s genetics.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m not sure what the prescription is, but it&#8217;s nothing traumatic. And a good thing to know that I don&#8217;t have glaucoma.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Thursday I managed to, um, locate, yeah that&#8217;s it, locate a copy of Windows Vista Beta 2, which has just been released out for people to have a look with. I had initially been relatively excited about Vista (when it was still known as Longhorn) because of some of the cool features that were being worked on: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinFS">WinFS</a> being the main thing, with some of the Avalon stuff and general improvements looking to be pretty good.</p>


	<p>I format the C Drive (which I needed to do anyway because my XP install was almost a year old), fire up the setup program. It all runs relatively smoothly, a faster process than XP, and seemingly without any of the legacy <span class="caps">DOS</span> stuff that managed to hang around in some of the earlier versions.</p>


	<p>Once I&#8217;m up and running I start to have a poke around, and I notice some of the differences from XP (the new Aero shell the most obvious): A whacked out Control Panel with all of the functionality spread out into what seems like 500 different, non-logically divided up places. I tried, without success, to change the location of my &#8220;Documents&#8221; Folder so it wasn&#8217;t on the C: drive; I struggled to find the way to set the properties on my network card; I managed to find where to change some of my display settings (to no avail, I had to download some new drivers from nVidia to make my <a href="http://www.nvnews.net/previews/geforce_fx_5950_ultra/">GeForce <span class="caps">FX 5950</span> Ultra</a> perform with some responsiveness, let alone verve and moxy!).</p>


	<p>It seems that MS have become so paranoid about security that they have decided to make it almost impossible to do anything on your computer without the annoying <span class="caps">UAC</span> dialog popping up. This window stops all other processes from running on the computer (which, for someone who uses <a href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net">Synergy</a> to share a keyboard and mouse between their Mac and PC, is astonishingly annoying) until you give permission for the process to continue. And just about every function in the Control Panel requires this action before it will change any setting.</p>


	<p>Now, I&#8217;m all for Windows to become more secure, but why couldn&#8217;t they have copied something from Apple on this one? In MacOSX there&#8217;s a little padlock on the control panel that lets you lock the settings down, and you can only change something if you click on this and enter your password. Simple and elegant, and it doesn&#8217;t take control of all of the operating programs on the computer while waiting for feedback.</p>


	<p>After wasting a lot of time mucking around with all of this stuff, I thought I&#8217;d see what this baby could do. And the answer seems to be not much. I played (or at least tried to) and XVid movie, and it was awful: jumpy, jerky, interlaced. Now, I have a fairly powerful machine and it shouldn&#8217;t be doing stuff like that, beta or no.</p>


	<p>I realise that it&#8217;s a beta and all, and that in the next 6 months until it&#8217;s released, there&#8217;s every chance that a lot of this stuff will change, but on first take I&#8217;m just convinced that my move to MacOSX was the right decision.</p>


	<p>Oh, and I trashed the Vista install and put Windows 2000 back on the machine. Sigh.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day a warning light appeared on the dash of our 2003 Mini Cooper, saying something was wrong with the <span class="caps">ABS</span>, which doesn&#8217;t go a long way towards inspiring confidence in a vehicle. It also didn&#8217;t make me too happy based on the fact that we just spent $1500 on tyres for the car and here was more money needing to be spent.</p>


	<p>So anyway, I&#8217;m sitting in the dealership waiting for the diagnosis and the dealer who sold us the car walks by. He now happens to be the general manager of the entire dealership. We get to talking and apparently they sell about 100 vehicles a month: 30 minis, 20 <span class="caps">BMW</span> bikes and the rest in normal beamers. That&#8217;s a lot of finance!</p>


	<p>And the problem with the <span class="caps">ABS</span>: faulty sensor. Cost: $380.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In preparation for having to be able to work while in the US in December (we&#8217;re going for xmas and such &#8230; a plane trip with a 5 week old and a 2.25 year old &#8230; mmmm, fun), and I priced out a MacBook Pro. It came to <span class="caps">AUD</span>$4613, which is a little pricey, but hey, it&#8217;s a sweet machine.</p>


	<p>As an experiment I went to the Apple US website, and priced the same spec machine. And what do you know? It comes to <span class="caps">AUD</span>$3818 at today&#8217;s exchange rate. $800 difference. Just because it&#8217;s in Australia? Even when you factor <span class="caps">GST</span> into it, it&#8217;s still about $400 cheaper.</p>


	<p>So, guess what I&#8217;ll be buying in the US?</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the light of Western Australia&#8217;s <a href="http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/australia/engine/match/251605.html">woeful performance in the Pura Cup</a> game against Queensland (that was still meant to be going on), <span class="caps">I IM</span>&#8217;d Phil and said:</p>


<blockquote>so, what should be happening now is that Gillies and Dorey should be mopping up the <span class="caps">QLD</span> tail to register the first win of the season</blockquote>

	<p>And in perhaps the best piece of fantasy cricket writing ever, he replied:</p>


<blockquote>
in my own dream state that is exactly what has happened. After Gilchrist had made a tidy 250 from 138 balls and Martyn a very stylish 303*. Then I would have had the Bulls 8-15 with Watson &#8216;retired dead&#8217; before a handy last wicket partnership of 290 took them to within two runs of victory before Bichel suffered a massive brain haemorraghe and fell on his own stumps cutting his carotid artery.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On one of the sites I&#8217;ve been working on for quite a while (<a href="http://www.schoolseek.com.au">SchoolSeek</a>) we&#8217;ve been wanting to add the ability for users to find out how far a school is from their current location. There are services that have been able to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocode">geocode</a> addresses for a while, but they were either based in the US, or cost money. Not a lot of money, but free is always good.</p>


	<p>A couple of years ago, <a href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a> launched in the US and opened up a massive range of possibilities for programmers to develop cool &#8220;mashups&#8221;, which took information from one site, mashed it together with maps from google, and created a whole new website. They were all really cool, but unfortunately (at least for the non-US based of us) it was nothing more than something we could sit back and watch &#8211; which was kind of weird because the team of developers that built Google Maps was based in Sydney.</p>


	<p>But <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/05/on-map-down-under.html">finally</a> the Australian version of google maps was released, and then recently integrated with Local Search, which means you can search on Pizza shotps near a particular address. Which is cool.</p>


	<p>What is even cooler (if you&#8217;re a ruby developer), though, is the release of this: <a href="http://geokit.rubyforge.org/">GeoKit</a>. It integrates with all of the major geocoding/mapping services and provides a huge range of options and services. So now you can do stuff like this:</p>


<pre>
add_1=GeoKit::Geocoders::GoogleGeocoder.geocode("1 St Georges Terrace, Perth, Western Australia")
add_2=GeoKit::Geocoders::GoogleGeocoder.geocode("1 York St, Albany, Western Australia")

distance = add_1.distance_from(add_2, :units =&gt; :kms)
</pre>

	<p>Which returns</p>


<code>
389.248018478531
</code>

	<p>which is, of course, how far it is between the main streets of Perth and Albany in Western Australia.</p>


	<p>Sawwweeeeeet.</p>


	<h3>Update</h3>


	<p>Well, that didn&#8217;t take long at all. A quick loop over the existing schools in the <a href="http://www.schoolseek.com.au">SchoolSeek</a> database got the lat/long information for all the addresses. Then adding this line</p>


<pre>acts_as_mappable default_units =&gt; :kms</pre>

	<p>to my Address model allows you to do this</p>


<pre>
@addresses = Address.find(:all, :origin =&gt; "18 Bland St, Ashfield, New South Wales", :conditions =&gt; "distance &lt; 10")
</pre>

	<p>which gives me all of the addresses within 10Kms of 18 Bland St, Ashfield. Nice.</p>


	<p>So, basically GeoKit let me add distance searching to the site within about 45 minutes (allowing 25 minutes for me to read through the examples and such!)</p>]]></content:encoded>

It does the post code look up as well. Extra cool. Thanks a lot.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was waiting for a backup to finish running last night, so I was just wasting time catching up on some feed reading, and saw a post about <a href="http://www.deliciousdays.com/archives/2007/02/10/someone-has-nibbled-at-my-bread-web-bites/">making English Muffins</a> from what is one of the best food blogs there is: <a href="http://www.deliciousdays.com">Delicious Days</a>.</p>


	<p>I had some time to wait, so I decided to give it a whirl. The <a href="http://winosandfoodies.typepad.com/my_weblog/2005/06/english_muffins.html">actual recipe is here</a>, and it couldn&#8217;t be easier. The dough needs to rise overnight, so it&#8217;s the perfect thing to make late at night. The dough is pretty sticky when you&#8217;re making it, but it&#8217;s fun to get the hands goopy every now and then.</p>


	<p>Then this morning, I punched the dough down, cut it up into pieces, gave it a second rise and then cooked them in the frying pan. While they were cooking I fried up some bacon, scrambled some eggs and bingo: perfect sunday breakfast.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Police have just announced a worldwide <strike>cynical money grab</strike> tour, and have launched a <a href="http://thepolicetour.com">website</a> to fill you in on all of the details. Unfortunately, whichever company they have tapped to produce the site seems to have just reskinned an old site, and haven&#8217;t even managed to do a find/replace particularly well.</p>

	<p>Hmmm, I don&#8217;t remember Mariah Carey being in The Police. Strange.</p>


	<p>Also, I&#8217;m still a big fan of The Police, and despite misgivings about the purpose of the reunion, I&#8217;ll probably go and see them if they come to Australia, but check this out:</p>


	<p>Do they really need to charge $100 for &#8220;Premium Membership&#8221;, just so that people can get their tickets early and watch a few videos? And if you choose the free membership, why do you need to give your credit card details? And why does it include a balance check, when they&#8217;re not going to charge you any money?</p>

	<p>Now, I&#8217;m assuming that the band actually had very little to do with this, but why do you need to jump through hoops, just to join a messageboard to talk about your favourite band? Really?</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past year, Australia has gone from being able to strangle the opposition&#8217;s scoring at the end of an innings, to being having one of the most expensive bowling attacks in the world. Now, <a href="http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/281283.html">this article</a> doesn&#8217;t attempt to show why, but it certainly makes for alarming reading.</p>


	<p>One of the most (for me at least) interesting tidbit is about bowlers like <a href="http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/columns/content/player/42272.html">Rana Naved-ul-Hasan</a> and <a href="http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/columns/content/player/50804.html">Chaminda Vaas</a>. The former is horrifically expensive during the first 40 overs of the game, but in the last 10 overs he is transformed into a miser. Vaas, on the other hand, is almost unplayable with the new ball, but turns into a regular pie-chucker in the last 10.</p>


	<p>No doubt the teams have this type of statistics up the wazoo, but it makes me wonder why anyone is bowling <a href="http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/columns/content/player/6278.html">Brett Lee</a> in the last 10 overs, when his economy rate skyrockets. Of course, that&#8217;s <a href="http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/current/story/281294.html">not going to be an issue</a> in this world cup. Unfortunately.</p>


	<p>On a side note, I wonder what that does to all of the sponsors plans for the tournament. No doubt companies like <a href="http://three.com.au">3 Mobile</a> and <a href="http://weetbix.com.au/">Weet-Bix</a> would have large campaigns centered around Lee for their advertising during the cup. Time for a <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=5n97H9bn0Hg">few new ideas</a> I think.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even though I&#8217;ve had an account for a few months, I&#8217;ve only just really started looking into <a href="http://www.scouta.com">Scouta</a>, an audio and video recommendation service that was developed in Perth, and founded (in part) by Richard Giles. The basic idea is that you can watch videos/listen to music, and tag it, as well as rate it. Then based upon your voting, you get recommendations. You can also subscribe to your recommendations list via iTunes (something that I presume will work better when they release a plugin shortly!)</p>


	<p>While I&#8217;m not exactly a fan of the design, I think the service is pretty cool, and it&#8217;s great to see them getting <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/23/scouta-media-recommendations-soon-in-itunes/">some recognition</a> from the big news sites. It&#8217;s also great to see that it&#8217;s privately funded. Congrats to Richard.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Great that you like Scouta.

It also takes into account things you add, so not just based on voting :). Soon it'll be even more clever, and take into account descriptions and tags.

Know any good local designers? I'm seriously in need of someone who could contract in to design, do some UI work, and icons. Flick me an email if you have ideas of people (or ideas for Scouta). Prefer someone with UI and design...but immediately need a designer for some page work and an OS X icon for the iTunes agent.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As much as <a href="http://jordanbrock.com/2007/2/11/watson-induced-apathy">it pains me to say it</a>, <a href="http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/current/story/287132.html">Watson&#8217;s throw</a> was simply brilliant. Fast, hard and accurate. Totally game changing.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s hard not to see <a href="http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wc2007/engine/match/247478.html">South Africa&#8217;s performance</a> as a continuation of their susceptibility to pressure in big games. True, the game was just a group match, but the two points that get taken through to the next stage are important, and you could tell that each team desperately wanted the win.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Channel 10 and Formula 1</title>
		<link>http://jordanbrock.com/2007/04/08/channel-10-and-formula-1/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several years ago, after enduring the woeful coverage of Formula 1 on Channel 9 with the twin wonders of Daryl Eastlake and Alan Jones, Channel 10 bought the broadcast rights and promised a new era of Formula 1 coverage. It sounded great, and I was looking forward to being able to watch races live (or close to live as they put it in the press release), and with improved coverage.</p>


	<p>At first, they were good. Neil Crompton actually knew what he was talking about, and the races were shown live, or at 10:30 (after the Sunday night movie). I&#8217;m a realist. I know that they&#8217;re not going to broadcast something that doesn&#8217;t rate spectacularly well right in the middle of prime time. But at least it was within an hour or so of the race running, and at a standard time.</p>


	<p>Then, Big Brother started. It consistently ran over time, which meant you had no idea when the race was going to be broadcast. Of course, BB was ratings gold, so it gets precedence. But still, it was annoying, particularly for those of us who think that BB is an horrific show. But, it was just indicative of the lack of care/attention they were paying to Formula 1.</p>


	<p>And that brings us to today. The race is in Malaysia, which is in a similar time zone, meaning that it is run at 3PM Perth time. And when are they showing the race? 10:30 PM! OK, so there must be something that rates really well at 3PM, to take precedence? Let&#8217;s look it up. Hang on, &#8220;City Slickers II&#8221;???? <span class="caps">WTF</span>?</p>


	<p>OK, so you don&#8217;t care anymore Channel 10. It&#8217;s not rating? OK. Don&#8217;t show it. Let the rights slide and let Foxtel show it. They do a good job with the MotoGP.</p>


	<p>Sigh.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.perthfestival.com.au/">Perth International Arts Festival</a> website, done by the clever starfish at, um, <a href="http://cleverstarfish.com">Clever Starfish</a> has received a nomination for <a href="http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current.php#webby_entry_events">Best Events Website</a>. They are up against some big names, including the <span class="caps">BBC</span>, Mercedes Benz and Lollapalooza, so this is great news. Congrats to <a href="http://goatlady.wordpress.com">Kay</a> and team.</p>


	<p>And in the <a href="http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current_honorees.php?media_id=96&#38;category_id=45">Honorees section for News Sites</a> there is <a href="http://www.perthnorg.com.au">PerthNorg</a>, run by <a href="http://www.norgdom.perthnorg.com.au/">Bronwen Clune</a>. Once again it&#8217;s a fantastic site that is really pushing up against some of the established players in the market, and (I&#8217;m assuming) a fraction of the budget.</p>


	<p>So, as someone said on <a href="http://www.twitter.com">twitter</a>, &#8220;Go Team Perth!&#8221;</p>

So, this is very weird. <br />
<br />
There&#8217;s <a href="http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/the_web/article1666489.ece">an article</a> in The Times Magazine today about <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a>. And for some unknown reason, it has pictures of a bunch of Perth twitterers (twits?), including your humble correspondent. <br />
<br />
Strange.

	<p>So I bought a new <a href="http://www.nokia.com.au/nokia/0,6771,98424,00.html">Nokia <span class="caps">N95</span></a>. Rather sweet indeed. Apart from the 5 megapixel camera (!), the wifi, the <span class="caps">HSDPA</span> and the huge screen, it&#8217;s got a <span class="caps">GPS</span>! A freakin&#8217; <span class="caps">GPS</span>. Which of course means I now walk around a lot with my phone out in my hand, looking like I&#8217;m watching a portable TV.</p>


	<p>I got the phone through <a href="http://www.three.com.au">3</a>, mainly because of their data packages ($30 for 1GB). I&#8217;ve not really cranked it up though. A year on Telstra has made me fear doing anything other than call people &#8230; mainly because of the enormous bill that you receive at the end of the month, just for trying to check your email every now and then.</p>


	<p>Of course, the <a href="http://www.nokia.com.au/nokia/0,6771,98424,00.html">iPhone</a> is due for release soon (in the <span class="caps">USA</span> at least) but it&#8217;s over 18 months away in Australia, and unless it gets a fairly major specs upgrade in the meantime, it&#8217;s going to be one of those &#8220;nice, but only if it had &#8230; &#8221; types of things. I mean, a 2MP camera? That&#8217;s so 2007.</p>

		<title>Fake Steve Jobs: Now with fake photo credits</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sure, writing about <a href="http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/">Fake Steve Jobs</a> is way old news, but if you&#8217;re reading this blog for a desire for timely anything then you need to consider a trip to an electro-shock therapist. After he (Fake Steve) was outed by some killjoy at the <span class="caps">WSJ</span> (or somewhere, can&#8217;t be bothered to do the research) there was a concern that the easter bunny had been killed and <span class="caps">FSJ</span> wouldn&#8217;t be as funny or as insightful. It didn&#8217;t take long to see that <span class="caps">FSJ</span> wasn&#8217;t going to take exposure lying down. In fact, he stepped into the realms of batshit insanity. And it was exactly the correct response.</p>


	<p>Anyway, not long after the outing, he ran an article with a picture by James Duncan Davidson, but didn&#8217;t put any attribution on it. Kinda naughty, and actually a bit of a red rag, and he was called out. A quick apology was issued, followed by more mirth. For example, check out the photo credits on <a href="http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/2007/09/dear-early-iphone-adopters-yeah-we.html">these</a> <a href="http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/2007/09/okay-so-you-just-bought-iphone-and-now.html">two</a> posts. I didn&#8217;t know that <span class="caps">FSJ</span> was such a fan of <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=_PPWDglTboI">Old Greg</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the introduction of the new iPod Touch and the addition of the iTunes Wireless Store for both the new iPod and the iPhone, does that mean that there&#8217;s an update for the AppleTV coming soon that will let us browse and purchase music/tv/movies online? Surely that&#8217;s got to be the ultimate. Sit on your couch, purchase an album and listen to it within 3 minutes, all using a remote.</p>]]></content:encoded>

	<p>People criticised the camerawork, but I felt it suited the film, and really helped involve you in the action. Need to re-watch the first two to determine if it&#8217;s as good/better than the first two. Regardless, I really enjoyed it. And actually got to go out to a cinema to see it! <span class="caps">OMG</span>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

	<h3>Things to do</h3>


	<p>Do this once</p>


<code>
gem install mongrel_cluster
</code>

	<p>then in the application directory</p>


<code>
capify .
</code>

	<p>then remove &#8220;require &#8216;deprec/recipes&#8217; from the deploy.rb file</p>


	<p>then put the following in to the deploy.rb file</p>


<code>
namespace :deploy do
  task :start,    :roles =&gt; :app do start_mongrel_cluster end
  task :stop,     :roles =&gt; :app do stop_mongrel_cluster end
  task :restart,  :roles =&gt; :app do restart_mongrel_cluster end

	<p>If you hunt around a bit you can get some of the apps from the iPhone that aren&#8217;t on the iPod (such as Mail.app, Google Maps, Stocks.app and Weather.app) and you can pretend like you have the convergence device you&#8217;ve always wanted.</p>

	<p>For years now, Mac faithful have &#8220;celebrated&#8221; <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2005/7/16/734">iCal Day</a>. The default icon for the iCal program was the 17th of July, as long as the program wasn&#8217;t running. When you started the program up, the icon would reflect the current date.</p>


	<p>Now, with the release of <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Leopard</a> Apple have updated the program so that the icon when iCal is not running has the current date.</p>

	<p>Vale iCal Day. A short, but bright life.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m going to jot down little tidbits I find while using Leopard, things that are good and things that are not so good.</p>


	<p>I like the revised Mail.app (though judgement still reserved on the <span class="caps">TODO</span>&#8217;s and Notes features). One thing I have noticed is that you can now do Gmail style searches in the main search bar.</p>


	<p><img src="http://jordanbrock.com/assets/2007/11/5/mail.app.search.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>Keywords that I&#8217;ve found work so far:</p>


	<p>from:<br/>
to:<br/>
subject:<br/></p>


	<p>Haven&#8217;t worked out how to do date based searches yet, and folder: or mailbox: don&#8217;t seem to work yet, but I&#8217;ll post more if I find something.</p>


	<p><em><span class="caps">UPDATE</span></em></p>


	<p>I found some more in the spotlight searching help file</p>


	<p>date: eg date: yesterday or date:24/08/07<br/>
kind: eg kind: document or kind:movie (this find messages with an attachment of a particular type)<br/></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Connecting to Joyent Accelerator with CocoaMySQL</title>
		<link>http://jordanbrock.com/2007/11/15/connecting-to-joyent-accelerator-with-cocoamysql/</link>
		<pubDate>Wed, 14 Nov 2007 20:07:00 +0000</pubDate>
		<dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>
		<guid isPermaLink="false">http:///2007/11/15/connecting-to-joyent-accelerator-with-cocoamysql</guid>
		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First things first: What&#8217;s an accelerator? And why would you care about connecting to it with CocoaMySQL?</p>


	<p>Well, basically, an <a href="http://joyent.com/accelerator/">accelerator</a> is kind of like a virtual server, offered by <a href="http://joyent.com">Joyent</a>. Calling it a virtual server is a bit of a misnomer, because it conjures up images of a linux slice, but it&#8217;s a bit more than that. Running on OpenSolaris, it&#8217;s built from the ground up to offer scalable hosting. You get root access, and the ability to do pretty much whatever you want with it. Out of the box, they are setup to be rather special RubyOnRails/PHP/Python servers, with mySQL all setup and running like a champ.</p>


	<p>OK. So where does <a href="http://cocoamysql.sourceforge.net/">CocoaMySQL</a> come in? Your accelerator comes with PHPmyAdmin configured by default, but sometimes you want a little more than that you know? And with an app like CocoaMySQL you get a sweet <span class="caps">GUI</span> to do all your admin tasks, and nice editing facilities.</p>


	<p>Because of the security built into your accelerator, you can&#8217;t connect to mySQL from anywhere but your server. Handy for preventing attacks, but slightly painful for server management. So, you need to open up an <span class="caps">SSH</span> tunnel, to securely connect to the server. But first of all you need to make some configuration changes on your accelerator.</p>


<pre>sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config</pre>
change the following parameters to &#8216;yes&#8217;
<pre>
AllowTcpForwarding yes
GatewayPorts yes
</pre>

Then you need to restart the ssh daemon, with the following command
<pre>sudo svcadm restart svc:/network/ssh:default</pre>

	<p>The next step is to setup an &#8220;SSH tunnel&#8221; between your machine and the accelerator, which is basically a direct connection between the two machines. All traffic that flows along this connection is encrypted, reducing the ability for someone to sit there and listen in on what you&#8217;re doing.</p>


	<p>The command I use for setting up the tunnel is</p>


<pre>ssh -2 -f -c blowfish -N -C username@accelerator.ip -L 3307/127.0.0.1/3306</pre>

	<p>This sets up a connection between port 3306 on the accelerator (specifically the mySQL port) and port 3307 on your local machine. To connect to your mysql server in CocoaMySQL you just connect to port 3307 on 127.0.0.1, which then just sends everything to your accelerator.</p>


	<p>And a screenshot of the config screen for CocoaMySQL:</p>


	<p><img src="http://jordanbrock.com/assets/2007/11/15/cocoamysql_configuration.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>Now, obviously, that ssh command is going to be slightly painful to type in every time you want to connect to your accelerator. So, here&#8217;s a <a href="http://textsnippets.com/posts/show/1254">handy dandy script</a> and configuration file that makes connecting to multiple servers a breeze. All you need to do is copy the setup in the config file and change the settings for each server. And of course, mirror those settings in CocoaMySQL.</p>


	<p><em>Thanks to <a href="http://www.cuddletech.com/blog/">Ben Rockwood</a> from Joyent for the <a href="http://forum.textdrive.com/viewtopic.php?pid=106780#p106780">tips on the config changes</a> needed on the accelerator</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<link>http://jordanbrock.com/2007/11/18/16-years-2-weeks-and-1-day/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In what sometimes seems like another lifetime, I lived for about 18 months in Edinburgh, staying at a <a href="http://www.highstreethostel.com">youth hostel</a>. While the population at a youth hostel is mostly transient, there&#8217;s more often than not a group of people who are using it as a base to live, while they save some money to fund the next portion of the trip. And through some weird timing mechanism, this population seems to move on in groups, so as one set of people leave, another group arrives.</p>


	<p>I turned up right in the middle of one of the transitions, and built a group of friends aka drinking buddies. I scored a series of crap jobs that funded trips to the pub and food, which was basically what life consisted of. Naturally, if you put a group of under 25 year olds in the same building for any length of time (eg more than one hour) relationships start to form fairly quickly, and with a level of fluidity.</p>


	<p>After I had been at the hostel for a few months, I noticed a girl who had returned to the hostel after travelling around Europe (who it turns out, left the hostel the day after I arrived, and who&#8217;s going away party I had been invited to, but declined). I was going on a quick trip to Paris, as you do, so I didn&#8217;t pay a massive amount of attention, but my interest was definitely piqued. In any case, I returned from Paris, and over the next few months we got to know each other fairly well, but only in a good friends sort of way.</p>


	<p>One day I, against all previous history, entered a radio competition to see Crowded House in a special show being put on by Radio Forth. I scored two tickets, so I asked this girl if she wanted to go along. She&#8217;d never really heard of the band, but a free ticket is a free ticket, so she came along. We went to the show, which turned out to be in a tiny little pub, and there was only about 50 people in the room. The band had played a show in Glasgow earlier that night, and were driving to Edinburgh to play this special show.</p>


	<p>Side Note: while we didn&#8217;t know it at the time, but as far as I can work out the Glasgow show was the last show that Tim Finn played with the band as a regular member, leaving the band that night, so they travelled to Edinburgh as a three piece again!</p>


	<p>In any case, they put on a typically wonderous show that night for more reasons than one. With the magic ingredient of music, it turned out to be my first date with Caren, who I have since <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/mrsparkle/187793/">married</a> and had two wonderful children with.</p>


	<p>And on Friday night, 16 years, 2 weeks and 1 day after that first date, we saw Crowded House for the second time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night, <a href="http://www.webindustry.asn.au"><span class="caps">AWIA</span></a> (the Australian Web Industry Association) held one of our semi-regular &#8220;Ideas&#8221; nights, <a href="http://www.webindustry.asn.au/ideas4">Ideas 4</a> to be specific. Rachel Cook (<a href="http://minti.com">minti.com</a>) and Lisa Herrod(<a href="http://scenarioseven.com.au">Scenario Seven</a>) each gave fantastic presentations to a great crowd (about 85 people by my rough count).</p>


	<p>Here&#8217;s Rachel&#8217;s talk. There were a few teething issues with the video, mostly to do with lighting and sound (lol), but it&#8217;s definitely watchable.</p>

	<p>Lisa&#8217;s presentation will be posted next week (there&#8217;s an upload limit, and I shot this in HD, so it&#8217;s pretty sizeable). I&#8217;ll post a link when it&#8217;s available.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Police - February 1, 2008</title>
		<link>http://jordanbrock.com/2008/02/01/the-police-february-1-2008/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been waiting about 24 years to see The Police. I&#8217;m going to write a longer post about the whole event later, but I just wanted to get a song by song, blow by blow account down.</p>


	<h3>Message in a Bottle</h3>


	<p>Ahh. Even though it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve seen them live, it feels like I&#8217;m putting on my favourite coat on the first cold day of winter. Feels like home.</p>


	<h3>Synchronicity II</h3>


	<p>Even though I knew what the set list was going to be, this took me a second to work out what song it was. It was good, without being great. Certainly at the right point in the show. Allows everything to get stretched out and ready for the long haul.</p>


	<h3>Walking on the Moon</h3>


	<p>One of a number of highlights of the night. The musicianship on display during this song was just astonishing. Stewart Copeland is a man possessed. Paul (one of my friends at the show) said that there just couldn&#8217;t be another band who could pull off a song like this. Just awesome.</p>


	<h3>Voices Inside My Head / When the World is Running Down</h3>


	<p>Done as a medley. Stings bass playing in this song was beyond compare: he was finger picking the bass with all five fingers. The highlight of the show for me.</p>


	<h3>Don&#8217;t Stand So Close To Me</h3>


	<p>A duet with Fergie. I had heard that she came out in Adelaide, which filled me with a bit of dread, but it actually worked kind of well. She didn&#8217;t try to hog the limelight, and her vocals were a bit low in the mix, so her tendency to shout didn&#8217;t overpower the song.</p>


	<h3>Driven To Tears</h3>


	<p>Another highlight for me. One of my favourite police songs for years. Brilliant.</p>


	<h3>Hole In My Life</h3>


	<p>It&#8217;s funny how you can listen to something for 20+ years, and never quite listen to it. Here is a guy, he&#8217;s 27, he&#8217;s married with one kid, and he write lyrics like</p>


	<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something missing from my life,<br/>
Cuts me open like a knife,<br/>
It leaves me vulnerable<br/>
I hate this disease,<br/>
I shake like an incurable<br/>
God help me please<br/>
There&#8217;s a hole, in my life.&#8221;</p>


	<p>I wonder if he was trying to tell Frances (his first wife) something at this stage.</p>


	<h3>Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic</h3>


	<p>A cool start on the guitar, and a great singalong song. And it sounds happy, even if it isn&#8217;t. A great buildup at the end of the song.</p>


	<h3>Wrapped Around Your Finger</h3>


	<p>Another drumming master class. A full percussion set appears on stage and Stewart goes to town. And another song that, if written by my partner, would make me sit them down with a cup of tea and say &#8220;Are you happy? Do we need to talk?&#8221;</p>


	<h3>De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da</h3>


	<p>Slightly low key &#8230; not in a bad way, just gentle.</p>


	<h3>Invisible Sun</h3>


	<p>A song about the &#8220;troubles&#8221; in Northern Ireland gets transformed into a song about troubles of a much more global scale through the use of photos of children in war torn countries, stricken with disease, misfortune and poverty.</p>


	<h3>Walking In Your Footsteps</h3>


	<p>This song threatened to blowout into a funk explosion at one point. I felt kind of disappointed that it didn&#8217;t, but it was still great.</p>


	<h3>Can&#8217;t Stand Losing You</h3>


	<p>You can tell that they&#8217;ve been playing this song for a while. It just rocked. As they broke into Regatta De Blanc in the middle bit, Sting used the floor pedal synth (that he used quite a bit throughout the night to add some extra power to the songs) and unleashed the deepest note I&#8217;ve ever heard. It just rattled through my soul. I defy anyone to remain seated during this song.</p>


	<h3>Roxanne</h3>


	<p>An ambling (in a good way) excursion through the song, wandering down many avenues, exploring and enhancing. I&#8217;ve seen it performed about 8 times by sting as a solo artist, but this was truly great.</p>


	<h3>King of Pain</h3>


	<p>Never my favourite Police song, this was good, but not a standout by a long stretch. And the normally subtle backing vocals on tape were a bit obvious at times.</p>


	<h3>So Lonely</h3>


	<p>Bliss.</p>


	<h3>Every Breath You Take</h3>


	<p>A song that just haven&#8217;t ever done it for me live (I think the original recorded version is unadulterated magic), but this performance transcended all of those and became something special. Fantastic.</p>


	<h3>Next To You</h3>


	<p>A good song to finish on, even though the previous one might have been a better place to call it quits. A good rock song. The first song on their first album, and the last on the concert.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s the second video from <a href="http://webindustry.asn.au/ideas4">Ideas 4</a> from last week. In this one, <a href="http://scenariogirl.com">Lisa Herrod</a> from <a href="http://scenarioseven.com.au">Scenario Seven</a> gives her &#8220;Usability is More Than Skin Deep&#8221; presentation.</p>


	<p>Once again, there were a few teething issues with the camera. I framed it using Harriet as a guide, but it turns out that Lisa is a little bit taller, which means there&#8217;s a little bit of wandering camera action going on for the first minute as I play with the tripod.</p>

	<p>It was a great night. I wished I could have hung around a little bit longer at the end, but I had to rush home (sick children and such &#8211; all is good now) so I missed out on the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rosemaryl/2231150589/">trip to Fast Eddies.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Second Chance</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve noticed that as I grow older, it has, for whatever reason, become harder to become &#8220;inspired&#8221; (for want of a better phrase) by music. Sure, I love it, listen to it constantly and couldn&#8217;t imagine life without it, but that real touchstone moment where my soul is moved by a performance or a song has become harder to find.</p>


	<p>The first time I can remember being transfixed by a song I was jumping on a trampoline and &#8220;Message In A Bottle&#8221; came on the radio. I must have been 7 or 8, but I can remember the sensation to this day. Music had been around before that, but it had never been an important part of my life. That moment changed that. I realised what could be gained from listening to records, the radio, or whatever. Incidentally it started a lifelong semi-obsession with The Police, but that&#8217;s a whole different post.</p>


	<p>There was an undending stream of moments/songs/performances throughout the next 20 years or so: the performance of &#8220;Sunday Bloody Sunday&#8221; in the Rattle and Hum film,  the guitar solo in &#8220;Soma&#8221; by The Smashing Pumpkins, Open All Night by Bruce Springsteen, &#8220;Where Do I Begin&#8221; by The Chemical Brothers, &#8220;Lithium&#8221; by Nirvana are just a few that leap to my mind. Moments where I can clearly remember hearing the song for the first time, and knowing that this is the reason I love music so much, and enjoy being surprised by it.</p>


	<p>Of course, one of the other great things about music is that it is completely personal, and as a result, you might look at this list and say &#8220;Bruce Springsteen? <span class="caps">WTF</span>?&#8221; But that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so good.</p>


	<p>As time has gone on, and perhaps it&#8217;s got something to do with having kids and having a bit less of my brain available to devote to stuff like this, but that moment has become rarified.</p>


	<p>And to today. I clicked on a link to a performance by Liam Finn on The Late Show this morning and boom, that moment was back.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="caps">SPOILERS</span>: While I&#8217;m not sure that Tilda Swinton&#8217;s performance was oscar worthy, and I don&#8217;t think I agree with <a href="http://www.kottke.org/08/02/michael-clayton">kottke&#8217;s</a> assessment of her character (I think what he sees as &#8220;weakness&#8221; was her morals surfacing against her career ambitions) and was to a degree a parallel of what Michael Clayton was going through, except that he managed to do the right thing.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m certainly glad that films like this are being made. The plot isn&#8217;t spoon fed, and you need to be paying attention.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/movies/awardsseason/06lim.html">choice not to have a traditional soundtrack</a> for this film was perfect. It helped create tension, and the shoot out/chase scene before was one of the best I&#8217;ve ever seen. While a small part of me feels that the Coen&#8217;s are treading over old ground, at least stylistically, it&#8217;s certainly one of their best films.</p>


	<p>Tommy Lee Jones was perfect, with a world weary tone in his narration that said as much as the words he used.</p>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After several days of repeatedly smashing my head into both a metaphorical and an all too real brick wall, I seem to have managed to get <a href="http://git.or.cz">git</a> and <a href="http://capify.org">capistrano</a> working happily together on my <a href="http://www.joyent.com/accelerator">Joyent Accelerator</a>. I&#8217;m also using <a href="http://github.org">github</a> for my git hosting, which threw up it&#8217;s own little challenge mid-way through the entire process.</p>


	<p>Now, I should probably also say that I already had my site up and running using subversion, capistrano and my accelerator, so this article isn&#8217;t necessarily going to help with getting everything setup the first time. For that, you probably need to read this <a href="http://wiki.joyent.com/accelerators:deploying_rails_apps">wiki entry</a>.</p>


	<h3>Things You Will Need</h3>


	<ul>
	<li>A github.org account</li>
		<li>A dedicated Joyent Accelerator (I have no idea how to do all of this on a shared accelerator. Sorry.)</li>
		<li>Also, I&#8217;m really only talking about RubyOnRails apps here &#8230; not too sure how applicable a lot of this is to other frameworks (it will probably help at least.)</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Getting started</h3>


	<p>Assuming that you have your project in a git repository, and have a <a href="http://github.org">github</a> account (and obviously an Accelerator) we can start.</p>


	<h4>Compiling git on your accelerator</h4>


	<p>Unfortunately, the first step in the process was, for me at least, a total nightmare. I&#8217;m not the biggest unix-head by any stretch, but I can do some basic tasks with a degree of proficiency. Unfortunately, I went into a dark place trying to get git compiled. One thing to note is that I&#8217;m talking about setting up the git client here, not a git server. Because capistrano executes scripts on your remote server, you need to have a copy of the client software setup for capistrano to call.</p>


	<p>So what did I do? There are a couple of helpful threads on the Joyent Forums:</p>


	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://discuss.joyent.com/viewtopic.php?id=22094">Got git?</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://discuss.joyent.com/viewtopic.php?pid=175313">Git and Cap 2.0</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://discuss.joyent.com/viewtopic.php?pid=177469#p177469">Installing git</a></li>
	</ul>


	<p>Hopefully those threads will put you onto the path of successfully compiling and installing git onto your Accelerator.</p>


	<h4>Setting up <span class="caps">SSH</span> keys with github and your accelerator</h4>


	<p>When you setup your account on github, you need to setup an <span class="caps">SSH</span> key for authentication. github has a <a href="http://github.com/guides/providing-your-ssh-key">really good tutorial</a> on how to do this. I have a user defined on my accelerator that my website &#8220;runs&#8221; under, so what I did was to create a key for that user which gets stored into the ~/.ssh directory. I then added the contents of the id_rsa.pub key to my github account, which allows that user to access the repository.</p>


	<p>Another tip: don&#8217;t forget your passphrase. It&#8217;s needed in the next step.</p>


	<h4>Configuring capistrano</h4>


	<p>Assuming that you have your capistrano deploy.rb file setup as outlined <a href="http://wiki.joyent.com/accelerators:deploying_rails_apps">here</a> there are a few changes that you will need to make to get things working with git.</p>


	<p><em>I&#8217;m using Capistrano 2.2 at the moment. I don&#8217;t think it will work with earlier versions because of the relatively new git support.</em></p>


	<p>Here&#8217;s my deploy.rb file:</p>


<pre>
  require 'erb'
  require 'config/accelerator/accelerator_tasks'

  set :application, "website" 
  set :repository, "git@github.com:your_username/website.git" 

  default_run_options[:pty] = true
  set :domain, 'XX.XX.XX.XX' #Your Accelerators public IP address
  set :deploy_to, "/var/www/apps/#{application}" 
  set :user, 'website_account_username'
  set :scm, :git
  set :scm_username, "github_username" 
  set :scm_passphrase, "your passphrase here" 

  role :app, domain
  role :web, domain
  role :db,  domain, :primary =&gt; true

  set :server_name, "url.for.website" 
  set :server_alias, "*.url.for.website" 

  # Example dependancies
  depend :remote, :command, :gem
  depend :remote, :gem, :money, '&gt;=1.7.1'
  depend :remote, :gem, :mongrel, '&gt;=1.0.1'
  depend :remote, :gem, :image_science, '&gt;=1.1.3'
  depend :remote, :gem, :rake, '&gt;=0.7'
  depend :remote, :gem, :BlueCloth, '&gt;=1.0.0'
  depend :remote, :gem, :RubyInline, '&gt;=3.6.3'

  ################################
  # Some tasks for the old server
  ################################

  task :after_deploy do
    # tasks to run after deploy
  end

  ################################
  # End tasks for the old server
  ################################

  deploy.task :restart do
    accelerator.smf_restart
    accelerator.restart_apache
  end

  deploy.task :start do
    accelerator.smf_start
    accelerator.restart_apache
  end

  deploy.task :stop do
    accelerator.smf_stop
    accelerator.restart_apache
  end

  after :deploy, 'deploy:cleanup'
</pre>

	<p>It appears that the important line here is &#8217;  default_run_options[:pty] = true &#8217;. This means that capistrano can respond automatically for the request for the <span class="caps">SSH</span> Key passphrase that github replies with when you try to clone the repository.</p>


	<p>If everything is working, you can type &#8216;cap deploy&#8217; and it should all deploy nicely. If you get this error:</p>


<code>
  [err] Permission denied (publickey).
</code>

	<p>then there&#8217;s a problem with your <span class="caps">SSH</span> key and your settings on github. Make sure the key you copied into your github account is the public key for the <span class="caps">SSH</span> in your .ssh directory.</p>


	<p>Hopefully, you&#8217;ll be up and running. If you have any tips, recommendations or corrections, leave a comment.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>How to access US iTunes content on your Apple TV in Australia</title>
		<link>http://jordanbrock.com/2008/04/10/how-to-access-us-itunes-content-on-your-apple-tv-in-australia/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the frustrating things about being an Apple TV owner in Australia is that we are missing out on a fairly major component of the experience: namely renting movies and purchasing TV shows. It&#8217;s possible to create a US iTunes account, but generally that&#8217;s involved having a US based credit card, which of course, isn&#8217;t the easiest thing to come by.</p>


	<p>Yesterday, I found <a href="http://forums.mactalk.com.au/20/45826-how-get-us-itunes-account-free.html">this guide</a> to setting up an account, which has some extra steps in it that aren&#8217;t entirely necessary, if you&#8217;re prepared to actually pay for some content.</p>


	<p>Basically, you just need to create an account on the US iTunes store. First, sign out of your iTunes account, (if you already have one of course). Then, at the bottom of the iTunes home page, select the US store</p>


	<p><img src="http://jordanbrock.com/assets/2008/4/10/iTunes_Store_Selector-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>Once you have the US store home page up, click on &#8220;Sign In&#8221; in the upper right hand corner. Then you will have the opportunity to create a new account. There&#8217;s a <span class="caps">EULA</span> you have to accept, and then you&#8217;ll need to enter some personal information.  The next screen is the payment screen. Make sure you choose &#8220;None&#8221; as your payment option.</p>


	<p>You will need to have a US address to enter at this point. The only point to note here is that the Zip Code you enter matches the state that you have selected. Choose &#8220;Done&#8221; and you should have yourself a US iTunes Account.</p>


	<p>All well and good you say, but that doesn&#8217;t do me any good if I can&#8217;t buy anything does it? True. What you need to do is get yourself a US iTunes Gift Card. You can easily do this by searching eBay for <a href="http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?satitle=iTunes+Gift+Card&#38;category0">iTunes Gift Card</a>=. Purchase a card. You&#8217;ll probably have to pay a small premium on the card, eg I paid US$19 for a US$15 card. Obviously the people selling the card need to make themselves a profit.</p>


	<p>Once you&#8217;ve got the card, the seller should email you a code, which you just cut and paste into the &#8220;redeem&#8221; section  on the <span class="caps">ITMS</span> home page. Then, you&#8217;ve got credit on your iTunes account.</p>


	<p>So, then you just need to add your account to your Apple TV, change the country in the settings and bingo, you can start renting movies directly from the US. The HD movie quality is excellent, and on my decent <span class="caps">ADSL</span> connection (14Mbps) the movie starts playing in almost no time.</p>


	<p>Happy watching.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Unfortunately, eBay has become overrun with scammers selling gift cards that they bought with stolen credit cards - they&#39;re even selling the cards for like half of the face value (which they can do because it didn&#39;t cost them anything). The problem is that when Apple discovers a card you used was stolen, they can cancel your account, and you could lose access to much of what you paid for. As an alternative, check out <a href="http://www.tunezip.com" rel="nofollow">www.tunezip.com</a>, they sell legitimate cards at a reasonable price.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of months ago, Radiohead held a contest to remix &#8220;Nude&#8221;, a track from their &#8220;In Rainbows&#8221; album. It was a particularly difficult song to remix, due to the fact that it is in 6/8 time. James Houston decided to take a <em>completely</em> different approach from everyone else, and rigged up an old ZX Spectrum, a scanner, a dot matrix printer and an array of hard drives to play the song. The result is just mind blowing.</p>


	<p>Bear with the first minute or so of the video. It&#8217;s the sound of it loading on the Sinclair &#8230; which is a sound a lot of the <em>cough</em> older <em>cough</em> programmers amongst us will be very familiar with.</p>

		<title>Freezing Rails with Git</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that the Ruby On Rails team has moved the codebase over to <a href="http://github.com">github</a>, some of the standard rake tasks aren&#8217;t working the way that they used to. When it was on <span class="caps">SVN</span>, it was possible to type</p>


<code>rake rails:freeze:edge TAG=rel_2-0-1</code>

	<p>and the appropriate version would be copied into your vendor/rails directory.</p>


	<p>Now if you do that, rake downloads a zip of the edge release. Which is fine and all, but sometimes you don&#8217;t want to be on edge &#8230; like in any production site.</p>


	<p>So, I found a <a href="http://smartic.us/2008/5/15/freezing-rails-with-git">screencast</a> that goes through the process, but I thought I&#8217;d actually put the text into a post, mainly for my own reference more than anything else.</p>


<pre>
$ rails path_to_app

$ cd path_to_app

$ git init

$ git submodule add git://github.com/rails/rails.git vendor/rails
</pre >

	<p>At this point, git will effectively clone the repository, so that you can then choose one of the branches to &#8220;freeze&#8221; to. Type &#8220;git tag&#8221; to get a list of all the available tagged branches. Choose the one you want and type</p>


<code>$ git checkout v2.1.0</code>

	<p>And that&#8217;s it. Slightly more involved than the old way, but still none too shabby.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Gmail and MobileMe - Living Together in Perfect Harmony</title>
		<link>http://jordanbrock.com/2008/07/15/gmail-and-mobileme-living-together-in-perfect-harmony/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://mail.google.com">Gmail</a> for about 4 years now, and it&#8217;s pretty much become the centre of my email life, with my various email accounts being funneled into Gmail. I&#8217;ve used it with both the web client, and Mail.app on my Mac via <span class="caps">IMAP</span>, and have been pretty happy with both.</p>


	<p>With the release of MobileMe and the iPhone 3G I made the decision to move to MobileMe (an Apple fanboi at heart, I wanted to keep it all within the one happy family &#8211; particularly seeing as work just bought me a MacBook Air.) But I was really reluctant to stop using Gmail as the repository of all of my email, both received and sent (awesome search, archiving and just to have a backup on another server).</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s relatively easy to setup forwarding from Gmail through to MobileMe, which you then add to your mail client (Mail.app on the Mac) and the mail will come in as per normal. But this would mean that any sent items won&#8217;t appear in Gmail, which in turn means that Gmail is only storing half of the picture. But with <a href="http://twitter.com/adrianlynch">adrianlynch</a> doing most of the legwork, we were able to work out a solution.</p>


	<p>There are quite a few little things that need to be done in order to fine tune the setup, particularly if you want to use multiple email addresses. I&#8217;ll cover those, and then get to the meat of the setup.</p>


	<h3>Multiple email addresses in Gmail.</h3>


	<p>Gmail has had the ability to support multiple email accounts for quite a while, and it all works quite well. First of all, sign into gmail, then go to the settings -&gt; Accounts tab. The bet we&#8217;re interested in is the &#8220;Send Mail As&#8221; bit. You can add all of the email addresses you want to have gmail send email for in here. Gmail will send a confirmation email to the address you enter (just to make sure that you are in fact billg@microsoft.com).</p>


	<p><img src="http://jordanbrock.com/assets/2008/7/15/Gmail_-_Settings_-_jordanbrock_gmail.com.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<h3>Setting up the email forwarding</h3>


	<p>There are two ways to forward email in Gmail. One is in the Settings -&gt; Forwarding and <span class="caps">POP</span>/IMAP tab, which will forward every message to the address you specify. The other way is via a Filter (Settings -&gt; Filters). I prefer to use the filter, because it allows me to get rid of some of the cruft mail that I don&#8217;t really ever want to see again (eg, one of my mail accounts flags spam as <b><strong>*SPAM</b></strong>* ... if I didn&#8217;t setup a filter to not forward this, I&#8217;d receive all of those emails in MobileMe, which is sub-obptimal to say the least).</p>


	<p><img src="http://jordanbrock.com/assets/2008/7/15/gmail_filter.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<h2>Setting up your computer</h2>


	<p>Of course, this assumes you&#8217;re using a Mac. If not, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re a smart enough person to work it out :)</p>


	<h3>MobileMe setup</h3>


	<p>First up, add your MobileMe account. It&#8217;s pretty simple. Just enter your MobileMe account details (same as your old .Mac account), and it should all be jake.</p>


	<p>If you&#8217;ve setup gmail to handle multiple email addresses, enter them all in the &#8220;Email Address&#8221; field, separated by commas.</p>


	<p><img src="http://jordanbrock.com/assets/2008/7/15/email_addresses.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<h3>Gmail setup</h3>


	<p>Now, you need to add your gmail account to the system, as an <span class="caps">IMAP</span> account. Follow the instructions on <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&#38;ctx=mail&#38;answer=12103">the Google Help Center</a></p>


	<p>Once you have added the account Mail.app will probably start downloading all of your mail from Gmail, which could take a fair while. This may or may not be something you want: your choice.</p>


	<p>After the mail has all downloaded, go into the Advanced tab for the Gmail account in Mail.app, and uncheck &#8220;Enable this account.&#8221;</p>


	<p><img src="http://jordanbrock.com/assets/2008/7/15/enable_this_account.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>Then, go back into your MobileMe account and set the outgoing <span class="caps">SMTP</span> server to smtp.google.com. All of your sent mail will now go through Gmail, which is great for archiving purposes. Because MobileMe is an <span class="caps">IMAP</span> server, it will automatically be copied up to the MobileMe server (because it&#8217;s storing a copy in your Sent Items folder on your Mac), which means it&#8217;s then available on all the computers you use MobileMe with, including your iPhone / iPod Touch.</p>


	<h3>Why did I enter the multiple email addresses?</h3>


	<p>If you have multiple email addresses, and you entered them all in the &#8220;Email Address&#8221; box earlier, you will now have the option to choose which address to send your mail as when you create a new message.</p>


	<p><img src="http://jordanbrock.com/assets/2008/7/15/sending_message.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>There&#8217;s one little gotcha here, and it&#8217;s why I mentioned setting up the addresses from within gmail before. If you try to send a message from an email address that Gmail doesn&#8217;t &#8220;know&#8221; about, it will replace the sender email with your Gmail address. This is obviously to stop you spoofing your address, but it took me a little while to work that bit out. So, just make sure that you&#8217;ve defined all the addresses that you want to &#8220;Send As&#8221;</p>


	<h2>Setting up your iPhone / iPod Touch.</h2>


	<p>Once you have the above system up and working, you can basically mirror that setup on your iPhone. You need to create both accounts under &#8220;Mail, Contacts, Calendars&#8221; in the Settings application. Then disable the Gmail account, and set the outgoing <span class="caps">SMTP</span> server to gmail in the MobileMe setup.</p>


	<p><img src="http://jordanbrock.com/assets/2008/7/15/iphone_accounts.jpg" alt="" /> <img src="http://jordanbrock.com/assets/2008/7/15/iphone_gmail.jpg" alt="" /> <img src="http://jordanbrock.com/assets/2008/7/15/iphone_mobile_me.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<h2>Push Goodness.</h2>


	<p><img src="http://jordanbrock.com/assets/2008/7/15/iphone_push_it.jpg" alt="" /></p>


	<p>If everything has gone according to plan, you should now have your Gmail &#8220;pushing&#8221; to your iPhone, and also appearing on your computer. And if you have multiple macs, and have sync turned on for &#8220;Mail Accounts&#8221; and &#8220;Mail Rules and Smart Folders&#8221;, then you will shortly have those settings on both of your computers.</p>]]></content:encoded>

One way around this is to enable gmail in Mail.app, and then copy all your gmail archived mails over to your MobileMe account, and then disable gmail. Of course, you&#39;ll then have 2 copies of everything (even though you&#39;ll only see one), but that&#39;s a good thing.]]></wp:comment_content>

I prefer to only have the one gmail address that I give out, so this isn&#39;t the biggest problem.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Oops. Kranos/others having this issue - <br><br>I don&#39;t know if this was the intended way to do this, but: if you&#39;re sending email from your iPhone, like a reply, just tap where it says "Cc/Bcc, From" under "To" and it will expand to three lines. Tap "from" again, and it will give you the choice of sending from your Gmail address or your MobileMe address. Tap your Gmail address, and you&#39;re all set! Same thing for Mac Mail: when you&#39;re sending an email, just click on the "from" dropdown box and select which address you want.<br><br>Though, you also have to also have your Gmail account activated on your phone. Which actually doesn&#39;t matter as long as you followed this posts instructions by doing the filter and marking all emails as read, so you don&#39;t get repeat notifications. Then just work from your MobileMe account in the Mail app on your iPhone, and you should be good to go.<br><br>Hope this helped.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Let me try to clarify what I mean by my non-superlative comment:<br>1. Push functionality on iPhone is available through two content providers: MobileMe and Exchange. There is a free alternative to MobileMe, which is mail2web. It support Exchange push protocol. <br>2. Having two email repositories, gmail and MobileMe, being setup on the phone IS redundant in terms of:<br>a. Data storage<br>b. Data management, since one needs manually synchronize deleted mails, etc<br>3. Lack of gmail push functionality is unfortunate and should be engineered by Apple/Google in order to avoid poor design people ought to use in order to get real-time notification]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Good article and one I have followed and set-up. Just to confirm one point - if I received a message to <a href="mailto:joe@example.com" rel="nofollow">joe@example.com</a> and I want to reply from the iPhone do I have to include the <a href="http://example.com" rel="nofollow">example.com</a> email account. Mac Mail makes it easy to reply by adding multiple domains to the set-up, however, this does not seem to be an option on the iphone. That being the case this is not really a good iphone solution - more an issue with the iphone.<br><br>Thanks for getting this far with trying to get to a single mail account, while trying to keep multiple domain addresses!!!!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I happened across a <a href="http://jordanbrock.com/assets/2008/9/6/_looong__enter_sandman.jpg">screendump of a 4Chan thread</a> today that had lolcat pictures that matched up with the lyrics of Enter Sandman. Someone posted a comment saying that they&#8217;d love to see it with the soundtrack. So, I fired up iMovie and bingo: Lolcat Sandman.</p>


<object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/WnpfJ6lkhvI&#38;hl=en&#38;fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/WnpfJ6lkhvI&#38;hl=en&#38;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>

	<p>Of course, the music copyright is owned by Metallica, but I actually had to go and buy it from iTunes because I&#8217;d deleted my &#8220;unofficially obtained&#8221; copy a while back.</p>


	<p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span></strong><br/>
Oh well, it was fun while it lasted. I got a takedown notice from Warner Music Group, via YouTube. I used the YouTube tools to remove the soundtrack. Sorry.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> has long had geotagging support, which is a great way of being able to browse photos for a particular town/region/whatever. However, if you&#8217;re in Australia, geotagging your photos with the Flickr map service boils down to blind luck. The maps are so bad as to be beyond useless, and in fact are laughable. Here is the highest resolution map for the western suburbs of Perth, Western Australia:</p>

	<p>Great huh? I mean, that light grey blob really helps you work out where you are, as well as that thing that might be a road.</p>


	<p>So, way to compete with Google there Yahoo!</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Slow Decline of Internet Explorer and Slower Rise of Firefox</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the past 8 years or so, <a href="http://www.fivesensescoffee.com.au/">5 Senses Coffee</a> has been both a client of <a href="http://spintech.com.au">mine</a>, and for the last 15 months, my employer. The public face of that work is the main website, which sells coffee, teas and other <a href="http://www.fivesensescoffee.com.au/shop/equipment/isomac-la-mondiale">wonderful items</a>. I&#8217;d like to think that the visitors to the website are a pretty good spread of the general population of the internet, not necessarily too technical/web based, and not too &#8220;Hey, what&#8217;s this internet thing all about?&#8221;</p>


	<p>Every now and then a story will appear in my feed reader about the use of one browser being higher than another, and more often than not, that site has a skewed audience, which means that it&#8217;s users are more likely to have the latest and greatest than other, less browser obsessed users.</p>


	<p>So, bearing in mind that this probably has no relationship to the wider world than any other site, here is the browser share of visitors to the 5 Senses Website over the past 21 months.</p>

Versions of Firefox as a per centage for visitors to www.fivesensescoffee.com.au
</div>

	<p>What is evident from these numbers is that while IE is still the dominant browser, with almost 2/3rds of market share, Firefox has been slowly and steadily increasing. But not necessarily at the same rate that IE is losing share. Firefox seems to be losing a bit of ground to other browsers, namely Safari.</p>


	<p>The interesting number is that Safari has doubled over the sample period. True, it&#8217;s still third by more than a few lengths, but it seems to be taking some of those gains from IE.  I&#8217;m guessing this is mainly due to the increased market share of Apple in general, and not some massive use of Safari on MS Windows.</p>


	<p>Other, possibly unrelated points that can be extracted is that FireFox users are more likely to upgrade their browser than IE users. This can be seen by the almost complete drop off in <span class="caps">FF 1</span>.5x users at the beginning of the timeframe, and the rapid rise of <span class="caps">FF 3</span>.x in the last 3 months, to the point that it almost equals <span class="caps">FF 2</span>.x. That said, there certainly appears to be some die-hard holdouts for <span class="caps">FF 1</span>.x, who are disappearing at a slower rate than those still using <span class="caps">FF 1</span>.5.x</p>


	<p>So, not a scientific sample and/or analysis by any stretch, but still interesting. The surprising item here is the doubling in share of Safari (which, in the authors less than humble opinion is the best browser there is.) True, it didn&#8217;t have far to go to double that share, but it still had to be done.</p>


	<p>The upshot of all of this is that, unfortunately, there is still a large portion of the internet population still using <span class="caps">IE 6</span> (approximately 20% of all visitors it seems), so it still needs to be supported, or those people need to be encouraged to migrate upwards. How do we do that? Well, your guess is as good as mine.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, thanks to the fine people at <a href="http://www.fivesensescoffee.com.au">5 Senses Coffee</a>, I trundled over to Sydney for <a href="http://south08.webdirections.org">Web Directions South 08</a>.</p>


	<h3>Thursday, 25th September 2008</h3>


	<h4>Opening Keynote &#8211; Lynne Johnson</h4>


	<p>Boo. So mismatched to the audience it wasn&#8217;t amusing in the slightest. If we were a bunch of magazine publishers from 2003, then it might have been interesting, but we weren&#8217;t, and so it wasn&#8217;t.</p>


	<h4>Derek Featherstone</h4>


	<p>Nubbins. Yay!!</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ll just pretend that the opening keynote didn&#8217;t happen, and that this was the start. It&#8217;s always good to see someone who A) has command of their field and B) is a great presenter. Totally comfortable on stage, and thoroughly knowledgeable about his topic, which he managed to make seem almost exciting, which is pretty hard for what is essentially a dry topic.</p>


	<h4>iPhone Development</h4>


	<p><a href="http://toolmantim.com">Tim Lucas</a> and Pete Ottery worked on the <a href="http://iphone.news.com.au">iPhone Site</a> and did a good presentation on some of their experiences. Perhaps because I had already started on the iPhone site for 5 Senses and I had already encountered most of those problems, I didn&#8217;t really come away with much. But that&#8217;s cool, because it was an intro level talk, not for an iPhone Dev Conference or anything.</p>


	<h4>JavaScript Libraries/Frameworks</h4>


	<p>Yeah, good times, much laughter, fun, and frivolity, and then when <a href="http://themaninblue.com/">Cameron</a> rolled out the Drum Machine &#8211; <span class="caps">FUCKING BRILLIANT</span>.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m not sure if I actually learned anything, except that just about everyone is using jQuery, and those of us still on Prototype are mocked mercilessly.</p>


	<h4>August de la Rejos</h4>


	<p>Hmmm, ok, but hold the ads.</p>


	<p>An interesting talk about the progress of user interaction with computers, as well as the psychology behind it, that had some wonderful videos outlining potential future developments, but was undermined by the fact that they were MicroSoft corporate videos. Oh well.</p>


	<h4>WebJam8</h4>


	<p>Bucketloads of awesome, mixed in with tasty beverages, fine companies that sponsored the tasty beverages, fine talks, and conversation. Mad times. Cannot wait until <a href="http://www.edgeoftheweb.org.au/webjam-9-will-be-at-the-edge/">WebJam 9</a> as part of <a href="http://www.edgeoftheweb.org.au/">Edge of the Web</a></p>


	<h3>Friday, 26th September 2008</h3>


	<h4>Jeffrey Veen</h4>


	<p>Hot. Wired.</p>


	<p>Awesome talk about visualising data, and what good design can achieve. Memorable, and featuring the entirely wonderful <a href="http://graphs.gapminder.org/world/">Gapminder World</a></p>


	<h4>Gina Bolton</h4>


	<p>No. Not good. I don&#8217;t know if Gina has a ninja like mastery of <span class="caps">CSS</span> (I&#8217;m guessing she does since she consults/designs for companies like Apple and has written a book), but statements like &#8220;from what I&#8217;ve heard when talking to developers, computers start counting at 0&#8221; doesn&#8217;t make code-monkey happy.</p>


	<p>A thorough understanding of your topic, and avoiding statements like &#8220;I haven&#8217;t checked the blogs for a month or so, so I don&#8217;t know if the <span class="caps">CSS3</span> Working Recommendation has been ratified or not.&#8221; Seriously!</p>


	<h4>Michael&#8482; Smith</h4>


	<p>Not too bad. Bit of a laundry list. Of course, any recitation of the trials and tribulations of <span class="caps">HTML 5</span> isn&#8217;t really going to be anything but dry. Still, good to hear for the most part. However, the take away from this, Gina&#8217;s and Douglas Crockford&#8217;s talk is that it&#8217;s been 10 years since any successful revision to <span class="caps">HTML</span>, CSS or ECMAScript, which just instills wonderful amounts of trust and faith in committees.</p>


	<p>And really? Michael&#8482; What is this &#8211; Burning Man?</p>


	<h4>Myles Eftos.</h4>


	<p>Huzzah! The <a href="http://madpilot.com.au">madpilot</a> flew like a crazy bastard over the top of the dangerous territories of OpenID and OAuth. And if that isn&#8217;t enough, he launched incursions into <span class="caps">HTTP 1</span>.1 as well as <span class="caps">REST</span> and <span class="caps">SOAP</span>. Lucky for all he came back unharmed.</p>


	<h4>Douglas Crockford</h4>


	<p>Good. Real code. Real ideas.</p>


	<p>And scary. (We are so totally screwed if even half of what he was saying comes to fruition.)</p>


	<h4>Mark Pesce</h4>


	<p>Oversold. A fishing basket full of &#8220;ok, but meh&#8221;. One of the apparent pitfalls of giving what, from all accounts, was an amazing presentation at <span class="caps">WDS07</span> that inspired everyone who went, is that the next year expectations are particularly high. When those expectations aren&#8217;t met (probably through no fault of Marks) it leaves people underwhelmed. I didn&#8217;t necessarily agree with the central theme of the presentation (that twitter and the like are going to transform society and its&#8217; institutions), so that didn&#8217;t help.</p>


	<p>One thing I will say is that if you need to make a point that you <em>aren&#8217;t going to do next year&#8217;s closing keynote</em>, you probably shouldn&#8217;t be doing this years.</p>


	<p>A slight down to end on.</p>


	<h4><span class="caps">DRINKS</span>!!!!!</h4>


	<p>Wheee! All that needs to be said can be summed up in these two tweets that I, um, twitted.</p>


	<p>Salad is what food eats<br/>
<em>09:19 PM September 26, 2008 from twitterrific</em></p>


	<p>Has teh drunk on. Hi meat lady!<br/>
<em>12:18 AM September 27, 2008 from twitterrific</em></p>


	<h4>Would I go again?</h4>


	<p>Totally. As <a href="http://edgeoftheweb.com.au">we are no doubt about to find out</a>, running a conference is a tricky thing. Getting a mix of the right speakers, hoping they are all in top form, and cultivating the vibe is no doubt a difficult thing. I had a great time in Sydney: I met some great people, learned lots, felt inadequate (I mean, you&#8217;re talking to Douglas Crockford over a beer &#8230; what do you say?), and saw a Europe video on a large screen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although it only seems like yesterday that I got back from Sydney and the wonderful <a href="http://south08.webdirections.org/">Web Directions South</a>, things are rapidly heating up for Perth&#8217;s own Web Conference: <a href="http://www.edgeoftheweb.org.au">Edge of the Web</a>, taking place at the <a href="http://www.edgeoftheweb.org.au/venue/"><span class="caps">UWA</span> Club</a> on November 6 and 7, 2008 &#8211; <a href="http://www.edgeoftheweb.org.au/registration/">tickets available now!</a>.</p>


	<p>There is a <a href="http://www.edgeoftheweb.org.au/program/">huge list of international and national speakers on the program</a>, one of whom is <a href="http://weblog.200ok.com.au">Ben Buchanan</a>. I recently conducted a short email interview with Ben, talking about some of the subjects that he&#8217;ll touch upon in his talk <a href="http://www.edgeoftheweb.org.au/program">Hacking Humans: Advocating for a better web</a></p>


<div class="block">

	<p><strong>Q: Is there a disconnect between how our clients see what we do, and how we actually work?</strong></p>


	<p>A: I think there is. For example I think as a group web developers are diverse, interesting and definitely creative thinkers; but many clients are dismissive of developers.</p>


	<p>Professionally, we use lateral thinking and creative problem solving on a daily basis. Building a system also requires a solid understanding of the business it supports – so developers often have a well informed and fresh perspective about a business. The potential benefits can easily go beyond the boundaries of web systems.</p>


	<p>But the view of web developers as boring functionaries means many bosses or clients don&#8217;t really listen to their web geeks, and their business suffers as a result. In projects, geeks should be involved from strategy onwards and not just brought in at the end to grind out some code.</p>


	<p><strong>Q: What can we do to help bridge that divide?</strong></p>


	<p>A: Well I think the problem does stem from a grain of truth – and geeks can be pretty dismissive of people who are less technically competent, which isn&#8217;t helpful. We need to take a look at the way we present our achievements and ideas; and what role we step up to play in our professional dealings. Are we coming across as roadblocks or problem solvers? If we can adjust that then it might open up better working relationships.</p>


	<p><strong>Q: Do you think that the way that web professionals can approach the &#8220;process&#8221; can dehumanise the people we&#8217;re building the site for &#8211; the end users?</strong></p>


	<p>A: There&#8217;s a danger of letting technical or resourcing issues distract from the humans who need to use the final product. We can be a bit too clinical and detached from the real, live people and what they&#8217;re trying to do.</p>


	<p>People don&#8217;t go looking for a school location database, they go looking for a great school for their kids. They don&#8217;t look for an online store, they look for a cool gift their partner will love. We should think and build accordingly.</p>


	<p>I think it shows when a system was built for the human stuff, as opposed to sites and systems built because “we have to have a website”.</p>


	<p><strong>Q: Managing expectations is obviously an important part of the job. Have you got any advice for new players?</strong></p>


	<p>A: This is a bit of a “depends” question, because it&#8217;s driven by the culture and people you&#8217;re dealing with. But when people ask if something can be done, I am a believer in speaking the truth and explaining the options available. Because ultimately anything is “possible”, it&#8217;s just a matter of having enough time, people and money!</p>


	<p>What people really need to know is what&#8217;s possible in the current scenario and what they can do to achieve their goals. That might mean guiding them through a prioritisation process – if they&#8217;re asking for fifty things, they probably don&#8217;t need fifty things, at least to start with.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s not about being negative, it&#8217;s about being realistic and focussed.</p>


</div>

	<p>Ben is just one of a range of awesome speakers who are going to be presenting at Edge of the Web on the 6th November. On the following day, there are <a href="http://www.edgeoftheweb.org.au/program/workshops/">4 half-day workshops</a> on a diverse range of topics.</p>


	<p>And then, to cap the two days off in style, Friday night sees the <a href="http://www.wawebawards.com.au">WA Web Awards</a>, where, in a burst of glorious self congratulation, the best of the WA Web industry are recognised for their efforts. <a href="http://www.wawebawards.com.au/tickets/">Get your tickets here</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>2nd Gen Accelerators, Rails and attachment_fu</title>
		<link>http://jordanbrock.com/2008/10/17/2nd-gen-accelerators-rails-and-attachment-fu/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>File this one under <span class="caps">WTF</span>.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;ve been working on an updated version of the <a href="http://www.soilquality.org.au">Soil Quality</a> website for a little while now, and recently needed to deploy the site to a staging server for testing. I ordered up a <a href="http://www.joyent.com/accelerator/">1/4Gb Accelerator</a> from <a href="http://www.joyent.com">Joyent</a>, configured it, and <a href="http://wiki.joyent.com/accelerators:deploying_rails_apps">deployed</a> the app, just like I&#8217;ve done with 20+ other sites, and <span class="caps">BOOM</span>, straight into a brick wall.</p>


	<p>I opened up the log files and saw this error:</p>


<pre>
** Daemonized, any open files are closed.  Look at /tmp/soilquality-mongrel.8200.pid and log/mongrel.8200.log for info.
** Starting Mongrel listening at 127.0.0.1:8200
** Define INLINEDIR or HOME in your environment and try again
</pre>

	<p>Wonderfully descriptive I know, but something I&#8217;d never run into before. So, fire the the google and it turns out it&#8217;s a common error, with a common fix: just put</p>


<code>ENV['INLINEDIR'] = RAILS_ROOT + "/tmp"</code>

	<p>into your config/environment.rb file, make sure the directory exists and that it&#8217;s writeable by the mongrel, restart, and away you go.</p>


	<p>But of course, that didn&#8217;t fix it, did it.</p>


	<p>Much hair pulling ensued. I finally enlisted the help of <a href="http://blog.ninjahideout.com/">Darcy Laycock</a> and together we managed to track the problem down to the <a href="http://github.com/technoweenie/attachment_fu/tree/master">attachment_fu plugin</a>, which was causing the problem as the mongrel process booted. OK, so now we knew where the problem lay, but what was causing it.</p>


	<p>It turned out to be the ImageScience image processor, or more specifically the way the attachment_fu plugin and ImageScience work together <strong><span class="caps">ON A 2ND GENERATION JOYENT ACCELERATOR</span></strong> &#8211; eg the ones that use pkgsrc. Didn&#8217;t seem to cause the problem on an ubuntu machine, nor on one of the older BlastWave based Accelerators. I&#8217;m not sure why as of yet, as I was more worried about getting some sleep last night when we managed to fix the problem.</p>


And the fix? Basically, strip ImageScience out of attachment_fu. Remove
<pre>vendor/plugins/attachment_fu/lib/technoweenie/attachment_fu/processors/image_science_processor.rb</pre>
and remove &#8220;ImageScience&#8221; from this line
<pre>@@default_processors = %w(ImageScience Rmagick MiniMagick Gd2 CoreImage)</pre>
in this file
<pre>vendor/plugins/attachment_fu/lib/technoweenie/attachment_fu/attachment_fu.rb</pre>

	<p>Like I said, I have no real idea why this is happening at the moment, but I&#8217;ll try and work it out and update this post if I get anywhere.</p>


	<p>Once again, thanks to Darcy for A) being a sounding board, B) helping fix the problem and C) being up and available when I needed him :)</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Singapore - Little India</title>
		<link>http://jordanbrock.com/2009/01/10/singapore-little-india/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to the generosity of my rocking parents, we recently spent 10 days in Singapore, staying at <a href="http://www.thesentosa.com.au">The Sentosa Resort</a> on <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#38;hl=en&#38;geocode=&#38;time=&#38;date=&#38;ttype=&#38;q=sentosa+island">Sentosa Island</a>. While the idea of staying in Singapore for 10 days might not seem to be particularly relaxing, Sentosa is quite removed from all of the hustle of Singapore, and could be a tropical resort island anywhere. If you wanted to, you could quite happily spend all of your time on Sentosa, and not venture into the city at all.</p>


	<p>However, we did spend a bit of time in Singapore, and one of the best places we went was to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_India,_Singapore">Little India</a>. There&#8217;s a large Indian population in Singapore, and they seem to be largely centered around the Little India area.</p>


	<p>One of the things you notice about Singapore is the massive amount of construction that&#8217;s been going on, and the fact that almost none of the &#8220;old Singapore&#8221; remains, having been bulldozed and rebuilt with modern buildings. Little India, by contrast, is almost in original condition. It doesn&#8217;t have any of the sanitised vibe that exists elsewhere in Singapore. As a result, it&#8217;s certainly the most vibrant and lively area that we went to.</p>


	<p>Another great thing about Little India is the food. Eating out in Singapore can be quite expensive if you head to the &#8220;western&#8221; restaurants, but if you want to eat some of the &#8220;local&#8221; foods, then it&#8217;s quite remarkable how cheaply you can eat. We ate (twice it turns out) in a wonderful tandoori restaurant, stunned at how little everything cost. A <a href="http://www.indianfoodforever.com/non-veg/chicken/chicken-tikka.html">chicken tikka</a>, <a href="http://www.indianfoodforever.com/vegetables/methi-aloo.html">aloo methi</a>, <a href="http://www.indianfoodforever.com/indian-breads/naan.html">naan</a>, <a href="http://www.indianfoodforever.com/raita/">raita</a>, rice and samosas for $30. Gold.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few months, I have been slowly putting together a backup system that uses both local and online storage systems to provide a level of security and peace of mind.</p>


	<h2>Backup Overview</h2>


	<p>Using a combination of <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">Super Duper</a>, a couple of backup external <span class="caps">HDD</span>&#8217;s, <a href="https://www.getdropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>, <a href="http://www.jungledisk.com/">Jungle Disk</a> and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> I have built up what I think is a relatively comprehensive and reliable backup system.</p>


	<h3>Local Backups</h3>


	<p>SuperDuper is a wonderful program that creates bootable mirrors of a hard drive. Effectively what this means is that if a hard drive fails, you can just replace it with the backup copy. You can schedule the backups to run as often as you want, which ensures that your backup copy is fresh and useable in case of a disaster.</p>


	<p>And what am I backing up? I have two main drives that I use: The system disk (the built in drive in my iMac which contains all of my work files, personal documents, applications and the Operating System), and an external FireWire800 drive that stores photographs, videos, movies and TV shows.</p>


	<h3>Amazon S3</h3>


	<p>Amazon S3 is basically an online storage system that can be accessed via an <span class="caps">API</span> to upload, manage and retrieve data. Amazon charges for both the uploading of data (US$0.10 per Gb), and then for the actual storage of that data. The uploading charge is a one off cost, and the storage costs are charged monthly (US$0.15 per Gb per month).</p>


	<h3>Jungle Disk</h3>


	<p>One downfall of S3 is that it&#8217;s not actually setup to be used without additional software to manage the mechanics of the backups. Step up Jungle Disk. It&#8217;s pretty simple software: you give it your S3 account details, tell it what to backup, when to back it up and it will go ahead and take care of it for you. Simple. And then you get your monthly bill from S3. Nothing else to do.</p>


	<p>One big downside of the whole online backup setup is the time it takes to actually backup any large amount of data, and that&#8217;s a limitation of my internet connection more than anything else. When you&#8217;re uploading 100+Gb, be prepared for a bit of a wait :)</p>


	<h2>The cost of Amazon S3</h2>


	<p>While the monthly cost of the Amazon S3 service makes it a perfect online backup solution for data that you would class as priceless (photos, videos of the kids, work files, personal documents), when it comes to backing up stuff that can be easily replaced at a relatively low cost, such as iTunes TV shows and Movies, there soon comes a point where it&#8217;s not actually economically feasible to use online storage.</p>


	<h3>iTunes TV Shows</h3>


	<p>The average 1 hour (42 minutes of network TV) HD episode of a TV show on iTunes is about 1.4Gb. In addition to this, you also get an iPod/iPhone compatible SD version which is generally 600Mb. So, a single TV show is effectively 2Gb of data that needs to be backed up.</p>


	<p>What is the cost of backing this file(s) up? Well, there&#8217;s a US$0.20 charge for uploading it to Amazon S3 initially, and then a US$0.30 charge per month. At that rate, it only takes 10 months of storing the data online until you&#8217;ve actually paid for the file twice. This means that if you lost the original file 12 months after you first bought it, you&#8217;d actually be better off buying the file again.</p>


	<p>This effectively renders online backups for iTunes TV Shows pointless, considering how often you&#8217;re actually likely to watch a TV show, and also how cheap the cost of having a local <span class="caps">HDD</span> mirror is.</p>


	<h3>iTunes Movies</h3>


	<p>Currently iTunes Movies are only available in SD (boo to the movie studios and Apple for this one) so the files aren&#8217;t as large as they could be, but they&#8217;re still pretty sizable, weighing in at 1.67Gb for the recent &#8220;The Dark Knight&#8221;, which cost US$14.99. And how long until it&#8217;s not feasible to store this on Amazon S3?</p>


	<p>At the purchase price, it would take 4.99 years until you&#8217;ve paid twice. However, Apple drops the price of new release films to $9.99 after about 4-6 months, so the replacement cost is greatly reduced. At this price the cut-off becomes 3.33 years. Obviously this timeframe requires a judgement call as to whether or not it&#8217;s worth it. Personally, I&#8217;d rather just trust my local <span class="caps">HDD</span> backups.</p>


	<h3>iTunes/Amazon Music</h3>


	<p>Music files are obviously considerably smaller than video files, and as such are going to incur a greatly reduced monthly fee for storage. Your average iTunes album costs approximately US$9.99 and is generally around 110Mb. This small size means that it will actually take about 49.95 years until it&#8217;s been paid for twice, buy which point you&#8217;ll either be A) dead, or B) listening to music on your personal bone implant that plays whatever music you want that&#8217;s being broadcast by SkyNet.</p>


	<p>So, music is one area where it&#8217;s probably economical to maintain an online backup of your files, particularly considering how annoying it would be to go and re-purchase the 800+ albums you&#8217;ve got in your library in the first place.</p>


	<h2>Other possible solutions and problems.</h2>


	<p>Whenever you&#8217;re talking about local <span class="caps">HDD</span> backups, it&#8217;s always worth considering a <a href="http://www.drobo.com/">Drobo</a>, which is a redundant array of <span class="caps">HDD</span>&#8217;s that theoretically keeps your data happy and safe. I don&#8217;t have a Drobo, but I know that users who have one swear by them.</p>


	<p>The one problem with local backups is that, of course, they are susceptible to local threats, e.g. fire and theft. There&#8217;s no point in having duplicate hard drives that slavishly mirror each other if some reprobate comes along and pilfers them both. Which means you need a third mirror, that you store off-site. Which in turn means you need a fourth drive that you store off-site in rotation with the third one. An endless cycle.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Using git to sync configurations between two computers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have two machines that I use for my development work: a 24" iMac and a MacBook Air (It is so choice. If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up. _Bonus points for quote identification_). Naturally, doing any work spread over two machines leads to all sorts of problems: Inconsistencies in development platform, files, data, code and just the general configuration of the machine. Thankfully, there exists a number of solutions to these problems.
<h3><a href="http://www.getdropbox.com">DropBox</a></h3>
DropBox is simply file synchronisation done right. You install it, drag the files you want to have synced between two computers into the Dropbox folder, and BOOM, it copies everything up to their server, and when you set it up on the second computer, copies everything back down again. After the initial sync, which can take quite a while if you've got lots of stuff, it's pretty much seamless. Create, or make a change to, a file on one computer, and before you know it, it's available on the other computer.

Need access to those files from another computer, or even from your phone? No problem, they have a web interface that give you full access to all of your "synced" files. Simple.

To add a lovely cherry to the ice cream sundae that is DropBox, they also have versioning. That means if you make a series of dunderhead changes to a document, you can just rollback to the last good copy. Awesome.
<h3><a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and <a href="http://www.github.com/">GitHub</a></h3>
For the longest time (mostly while I was still working on Windows) "Source Control" was some mystical mumbo jumbo that only people in large companies needed to worry about. Of course, that was mainly because at the time the options for Visual Studio only included Microsoft SourceSafe, which is perhaps some of the crappiest, most unusable software ever foisted on the unsuspecting public by a company with a long history of foisting crap on the unsuspecting public.

Once I switched to MacOSX and started working with Rails, it became clear that all source control systems weren't created equally. Subversion seemed to be the choice of the community, so I loaded everything up onto my own SVN server. A world was opened up to me, and I could code with wild abandon, safe in the knowledge that I could rollback with no danger. Of course, that was the ideal world, but the basic approach worked. I created branches, tagged releases and deployed sites from SVN.

As with most things, people started grumbling about SVN and some of it's shortcomings: difficulties in merging different code branches, no distributed repositories and some general discontent. Git was the solution, and the rails community just jumped ships in the middle of the night. Before you knew it, everyone was using Git, and also GitHub. I won't go into the specifics of why this combo is so good, except to say that if you're not using git, well, good day to you sir.
<h3>git and <a href="http://github.com/jferris/config_files/tree/master">config_files</a></h3>
In addition to using git to store your development work, you can also use it to manage system configuration files. I found the wonderful <a href="http://github.com/jferris/config_files/tree/master">config_files</a>. It's a collection of shell, git, vim and irb configuration files. So? How does that help?

A great feature of git, and github in particular, is that you can "fork" a repository. You effectively copy someone else's repository, and you can then make all the changes to it you want, without affecting the original. If you want to let other people know about your changes, you can send the original developer a "pull request", and they can grab your changes, and incorporate them, or not.

So, fork the config_files repository, and then clone it to your own system. Run the "install.sh" script, which basically just sets up a series of symlinks in your user directory. These symlinks point to the files in the git repository. You make any changes you want to the repository and commit them up to github. Then do the same on your other computer, and bingo, you're synchronising your configuration between machines.

And why would you want config_files? Well, you get some great all round system setup tidbits, but my favourite bit is how it prints the current git branch as part of your prompt, saving you the need to try and work out what you're in the middle of doing.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While it's difficult coming up with a term for the relationships that we have with people that we interact with online, but not in "meatspace", it's harder still coming up with how to describe your relationship with people that A) you've never met, and B) you've never really even interacted with.

Around a year or so ago, someone posted a link to this photo on Flickr:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/godiex/327798644/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/140/327798644_483211785e_m.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>
<h4>duty</h4>
<em>Uploaded by </em><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/godiex/"><em>Godiex { ... }</em></a><em> on 20 Dec 06, 1.20PM WST.</em>

Certainly an interesting photo, and one that deserved further investigation. So, I started looking at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/godiex/">Godiex's photostream</a>, and noticed there were a few photos of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/godiex/2048993674/in/set-72157600733009151/">this girl</a>, who turned out to be his girlfriend. I found her <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/random-panda">photostream</a>, and then saw this photo

<h4>home town</h4>

which is a shot of the hill I grew up on (our old house is just around the corner). I thought that was pretty intriguing, and so I added both randompanda and Godiex as contacts.

It turns out that Godiex is an artist from Argentina, and that he and randompanda began a long distance relationship in the comments on a photo on flickr. So, all of a sudden, I'm watching the relationship of two people I don't know, who met through a photo sharing site. Their photos showed them being apart, randompanda going to live in Buenos Aires, and then the pain of separation when randompanda had to return back to Australia (I presume caused by visa-expiry). I'm guessing I felt an affinity for their situation, as Caren and I spent 10 months of our first 2 years together in different countries.

Through my virtual stalking, it appeared to me that they were waiting for the opportunity to be back together and that all would be well again. Then Godiex posted this photo:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/godiex/3572976564/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3555/3572976564_76bd27cc29_m.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>
<h4>this moon is over</h4>
<em>Uploaded by </em><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/godiex/"><em>Godiex { ... }</em></a><em> on 28 May 09, 5.10PM WST</em>.

In the description for the photo he basically said that their relationship was over, effectively being ended by the distance apart. It was weird. Here were two people that I had never met, and only shared the random fact that I grew up in the same town as one of them, and I followed their relationship through the photos they posted. And I was sad that they had made the decision to break up. And it's clear from the comments on the last photo that there's a large number of other people feeling the same way.

Well, I hope that <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/matt/1424625/">these people</a> are still together at least (read the comments on that photo for an amazing story).]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[A few years ago I started posting my photos in a livejournal group; and found one guy in particular often gave me really really useful critiques. He was so generous with his time; and clearly a professional who probably had a lot of work to do... i was really grateful. I ended up adding him to my friends list - <a href="http://kylecassidy.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">http://kylecassidy.livejournal.com/</a><br><br>Over time a certain girl started appearing far more often in his photos - in between all the photos of politicians, cats, vegan food and fetish models (not making that up). We knew something was up, and recently we finally got the "yay we got married in secret!" post. i really was pleased, like glowing happy-for-friends pleased, and the closest i&#39;ve come to meeting kyle was trading an email or two.<br><br>i think it&#39;s entirely possible to feel joy and sadness as we watch the lives of strangers online. there are humans on the other ends of all these wires...]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Another in the series of "Oh, I'd better write this down here so I don't forget it in the future" posts. This time, the gems needed to setup AutoTest for a rails app on Leopard

[gist id="164307"]
sudo gem install ZenTest   
 
sudo gem install autotest-fsevent 
 
sudo gem install autotest-rails  
 
sudo gem install redgreen
[/gist]

Then you need to create a ".autotest" file with the following:

[gist id="164310"]
require 'autotest/fsevent'
require 'redgreen/autotest'
[/gist]

Then it's just a case of typing "autotest" in RAILS_ROOT.

Simple.

		<title>Edge of the Web - Derek Powazek</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://powazek.com/">Derek Powazek</a> is presenting the opening keynote at the upcoming edition of the <a href="http://www.edgeoftheweb.org.au/">Edge of the Web conference in Perth</a> on November 4-6, 2009. He will be talking on the <a href="http://www.edgeoftheweb.org.au/program/derek-powazek-wisdom-of-community/">"Wisdom of Community"</a>.

<strong><em>Your keynote at Edge of the Web is titled "The Wisdom of Community". How do you define a community on the web?</em></strong>

I like to take the broadest possible definition, so I'd say that a community is any group of people brought together by some common denominator. Lots of things have invisible communities around them - people who care about that thing - even if they haven't ever met each other. The web gives us the power to find each other, which is why it's such a powerful, and terrible, place for social interactions.

<strong><em>It seems that, given enough people, a comment thread can quickly devolve into rapid fire insults and grandstanding. How can we foster and encourage thoughtful commentary and participation?</em></strong>

There are two parts to this, and you can only control one of them.

The part you can't control is human nature. People are weird, messy, and complicated. They react strangely to things. They behave irrationally in groups. And you can't change that.

The part you can control is how your website interfaces with that strange mass of humanity. Certain interfaces stand up better to the weirdness of humanity than others. It takes a lot of trial and error, and the line is always moving because we're evolving.

We're all still learning how to behave online. It's the first time in human history that you can be both alone and in a group at the same time. How weird is that? It's no wonder we haven't figured it out yet.

<strong><em>One of the benefits of investing your time and efforts in building a community is the the personal rewards that come from interacting with the members of the community. One of the perils of that can be when things start to go wrong and it can lead to heartbreak. You had a fairly public parting of the ways with <a href="http://www.jpgmag.com/">JPG Magazine</a>. Not wishing to get into specifics with you, but how hard was that to deal with, and did the community that you and Heather helped foster help you "heal"?</em></strong>

JPG was an enormous learning experience for me, both for what I learned about fostering creative communities, as well as learning some hard truths about founding a company. There are a million stories out there about founding partners in a startup falling apart. In fact, it's probably what happens more than anything else. The only difference in this case was that I chose to talk about it publicly. I did that because I had to - the community that built JPG deserved to know what happened. But one side-effect was that many other founders and entrepreneurs came out of the woodwork to tell me their stories. It helped me immensely to know that I wasn't alone.

The web never ceases to amaze me. When you approach it with honesty, it comes back a thousand fold.

<strong><em>With seriously large amounts of money going after the "Social Web", do you see people having multiple social locations (eg facebook, twitter, flickr, Goole Reader etc) as a hinderance, or does this fragmentation actually help, by allowing us to compartmentalise our social interactions into different areas, much like we do in our offline lives.</em></strong>

Good question! To a geek, this repetition of signup, login, create profile, over and over, just seems like an inefficiency. But people are inefficient. We all maintain multiple identities already. Who we are with our parents isn't the same as who we are with our friends. So I'm not as bothered by all these disparate digital identities as some. In fact, I think trying to meld them is going against human nature.

<strong><em>"Strange Light" was an intensely quick project, born from an idea and fully realised in less than two days, and seems to have had an incredible response both from photographers and from the web at large. Do you see these magazines as having their own community? Or one that augments existing online ones (such as flickr)?</em></strong>

I think that magazines are, essentially, communities. At least, the successful ones are.

In the case of the first issue of Strange Light, there were two groups out there: the people who experienced it were a community of experience, and the rest of us who saw the astounding photographs coming out of the storm formed a loose-knit community of interest.

I was hoping that a few of those two groups would want a beautiful printed edition of photos from the storm, and they did! What I like about this is it allows the web to do what it's good at (connect people) and print to do what it's good at (create a coveted object).

<strong><em>And finally, when the hell is <a href="http://magcloud.com/">MagCloud</a> going to deliver to Australia? It's not like we're on the other side of the world or something.</em></strong>

The short answer is, I don't know. But I can tell you why it's complicated.

Most of the printed matter around you right now is printed in China, put on a boat, and then a truck, maybe a train, and then another truck, and finally makes its way to you. It's horribly inefficient and disastrous for the environment.

MagCloud is changing all that, because we're going to have print partners all over the world. So when you buy a magazine on MagCloud, it'll always be printed as near to you as possible. That way the buyer pays less, the publisher makes more, and we expend less carbon shipping paper all over the world.

But that means shipping is much more complicated than just licking a stamp. We're setting up printing partners as quickly as possible, but it takes time. We'll get shipping here as soon as possible. Promise.

Derek will also be running a workshop on <a href="http://www.edgeoftheweb.org.au/workshops/">"Creative Community Building</a>. Tickets available now!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week, I was lucky enough to be involved with the <a href="http://www.edgeoftheweb.org.au">2009 Edge of the Web conference</a>, which was organised by <a href="http://www.webindustry.asn.au">AWIA</a> and <a href="http://www.redhorizonevents.com.au/">Red Horizon Events</a> here in Perth. We had speakers from around the world, around Australia and from Perth, who all gave great talks to an eager and attentive audience.

My role at the conference was basically to be the room monitor for the main auditorium, which meant that I only really got to see those speaking in that room. As a result, I didn't really get to see all that I wanted to see, but I can't complain in the slightest, because there were some fantastic presentations. And I got to see them for free. Which was nice.

So, here's a brief run-down of who I saw, and what I remember. Unfortunately, I didn't have a chance to take notes, so some of this is going to be hazy.

<h3><a href="http://dashes.com/anil/">Anil Dash</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/anildash">@anildash</a>)</h3>

For a few days it looked as though Anil wasn't going to be able to make it to Perth at all. Some last minute flight shuffling, and some program jiggling saw our opening and closing keynotes swapping. This meant that Anil would be able to come, and I'm fairly sure everyone was glad that he did. It was the perfect opening for the conference: an inspirational call to arms, urging us to embrace the open web and build the apps and sites that people will be talking about. Perth can be isolated, both mentally and physically, and it was great to hear someone talk about breaking the myth of Silicon Valley.

<em>Just a quick time out to thank Anil for his superhuman efforts in coming to speak. He ended up only being in Perth for about 35 hours, and spent 45 hours travelling to do that. I can't imagine how he felt at the end of the trip. Thanks heaps Anil.</em>

<h3><a href="http://lachstock.com.au/">Lachlan Hardy</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/lachlanhardy">@lachlanhardy</a>)</h3>

Having received the perfect lead in from Anil, Lachlan spoke in depth about the open web, the technologies available and the ethos behind keeping information free from copyright and the patent-lock. A great talk that hopefully encouraged attendees to challenge themselves to use open technologies.

<h3><a href="http://dmitry.baranovskiy.com/">Dmitry Baranovskiy</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/DmitryBaranovsk">@DmitryBaranovsk</a>)</h3>

Always entertaining, Dmitry has the knack of making a detailed and technical journey into the world of JavaScript highly entertaining. Quote of the day: "The public scope in JavaScript is like a public toilet. You don't know who's done what in there, but if you have to use it, touch it as little as possible"

<h3><a href="http://nickcowie.com/">Nick Cowie</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/nickobec">@nickobec</a>)</h3>

Local web legend Nick Cowie gave an informative talk on some of the upcoming features of CSS3, and how well they are supported in local browsers. He had a surprising example of some features that are supported by even the venerable IE6. One for the code monkeys.

<h3><a href="http://al3x.net">Alex Payne</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/al3x/">@al3x</a>)</h3>

Alex gave the opening keynote on day 2, and it was a great start to the day (ok, <a href="http://www.fivesensescoffee.com.au">the coffee</a> was the real start to the day). He spoke about how the languages and tools that we use shape the way that we approach our work. Watching Alex's talk, I was reminded of his tweet from when he was researching the talk:

"Researching tech history is a good reminder not to get too worked up about the tech of today. It mostly looks ridiculous in ten years." - http://twitter.com/al3x/status/5327550871

While we all love a good language fight every now and then, seeing a laundry list of forgotten languages, specs and companies certainly showed that it's not worth getting too worked up over.

Quote of the day: "Throw the wallaby over the bush fire."

<h3><a href="http://www.kevinyank.com/">Kevin Yank</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/sentience">@sentience</a>)</h3>

Being entirely in love with <a href="http://haml-lang.com">HAML</a> and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> I had only paid the slightest of attention towards CSS frameworks. Kevin gave a good run through of what they are, when they're a good idea, and how they work. I suppose it made an impact, because I actually started using aspects of the <a href="http://960.gs/">960 Grid</a> on a project at work.

<h3><a href="http://www.ashdonaldson.com/">Ash Donaldson</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/ashdonaldson">@ashdonaldson</a>)</h3>

Unfortunately, I only got to catch the last part of Ash's talk, so I can't really say a great deal about it, except that he has introduced me to an insanely addictive iPhone game: <a href="http://www.doodlejump.com/">Doodle Jump</a>

<h3>Malcolm Day</h3>

After two days of talking about the benefits of various development methodologies and discussions on W3C standards and the like, it was refreshing to hear a talk about money, and to earn it. Malcolm, CEO of <a href="http://www.adultshop.com.au/">Adult Shop</a> (NSFW!), gave an entertaining (and potentially libellous) talk on his journey from being an engineer for a mining exploration company to the CEO of a publicly traded ecommerce company.

<h3><a href="http://powazek.com/">Derek Powazek</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/fraying">@fraying</a>)</h3>

Wow, what a close! Derek was an exceptional presenter, taking us through the types of "crazy" that we encounter while building communities on the web, and how to deal with each of those crazies. Highly entertaining and hilarious, it was a brilliant end to the conference.

I'd like to thank everyone involved in the conference, particularly the AWIA events committee (<a href="http://myles.eftos.id.au/blog/">Myles</a>, <a href="http://milesburke.com.au/">Miles</a>, <a href="http://kay.smoljak.com/">Kay</a> and Helen) for their tireless efforts in putting on a wonderful show. I'd also like to give props to our international speakers, for taking time out of their lives to travel to the other side of the world to give a little something to the Australian Web community.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[File under "Things for me to remember when reinstalling stuff"

For me, one of the best things about using Ruby/Rails/Sinatra for web development is HAML/SASS, which allow me to quickly write and maintain HTML/CSS without having to worry about all the pointless stuff, like brackets etc. A by-product of using HAML/SASS is that when you have to write in something else, it causes me grief. JavaScript is a case in point.

Coffeescript (and to a lesser extent) bistro_car solve this. It brings the beauty of a ruby-like language to writing JavaScript, so that once again you don't have to worry about all the crap that goes along with it.

However, I ran into a slight problem when following <a href="http://drnicwilliams.com/2010/03/15/using-coffeescript-in-rails-and-even-on-heroku/">Dr Nic's setup tutorial</a> today. <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">CoffeeScript</a> worked, <a href="http://github.com/jnicklas/bistro_car">bistro_car</a> worked within the console, but it didn't work when accessing the page through the browser. But some path re-working, and a kind word or two from <a href="http://twitter.com/sutto">@sutto</a>, and we're good to go. 

For future reference, here's what I did. I'm using the <a href="http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew">homebrew package manager</a>. Mainly because it's awesome, and I use MacOS X, which is also awesome.

So, I installed node.js, coffeescript and bistro_car like so:

<code>brew install node</code>
<code>brew install coffee-script</code>
<code>gem install bistro_car</code>

Then, add the following to your environment.rb file:

<code>config.gem 'bistro_car'</code>

Create an 'app/scripts' directory in your Rails app, which is where you can store all your .coffee files (application.coffee etc).

You then get bistro_car to include those script files by putting this in your layout/template/page/whatever:

<code>coffee_script_bundle</code>

Then, you load the page, and bistro_car automagically uses coffee-script to convert your .coffee files to javascript. Except, of course, when it doesn't work because something is screwed somewhere.

As with almost every problem on a *nix computer, the problem is a path one, and thankfully solved with some simple symlinks. It seems <a href="http://www.modrails.com/">passenger</a> operates in it's own little world when it comes to paths, and it just didn't want to play nice with my environment. So, I tricked it as follows:

<code>sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/coffee /usr/bin/coffee</code>
<code>sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/node /usr/bin/node</code>

And that, my friend, is how you skin the unix path cat.

<blockquote>"We sell about 40 per cent less albums than we did three or four years ago because of [illegal] downloading" - John Butler</blockquote>
Of course, it's got nothing to do with the quality of the stuff they're putting out now. No. It's all because of the computers. Because computers weren't around three or four years ago.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you do integration/request testing of an AJAXified web application using Rspec, Capybara and Selenium there is a pretty good chance that you might have run into this error:

<code>Selenium::WebDriver::Error::ElementNotDisplayedError:</code>
<code>Element is not currently visible and so may not be interacted with</code>

After spending way too long to try and solve this problem ("THE ELEMENT <strong>IS</strong> VISIBLE DAMN YOU!!!!") I found a few little tweaks to my setup that help remove and/or mitigate the error.

The key to this error is that Capybara is trying to find and/or interact with an element and it's not quite ready on the page yet because some JavaScript hasn't executed yet, or there's a delay with the test web server.
<h3>jQuery Effects</h3>
If you're running tests, there's a pretty good chance you don't care about any jQuery effects. You're just interested in the result. If that's the case, then add this line to your page layout:

<code>= javascript_tag '$.fx.off = true;' if Rails.env.test?</code>

That will turn jQuery effects off in the Rails test environment.
<h3>Capybara "wait_for"</h3>

<p>
This is a particularly helpful method that, like its name implies, causes Capybara to take a chill pill, and wait for a particular condition to be met. Call it like this:
</p>

<code>wait_for(15) {page.should have_content "Some text."}</code>
<code>wait_for(30) {page.should have_button "Button Text"}
</code>

This just gives the page a little time to catch up before Capybara blows up on you.
<h3>capybara-webkit</h3>
A new Selenium driver from the fine folks at <a href="http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/4583605733/capybara-webkit">Thoughtbot</a>, this is a headless (this just means it doesn't open a visible window) browser that Capybara can interact with. Ideally it should be faster than opening up a browser window for each test. I managed to get it working, mostly. It's still kind of new, so there are a few things missing, but it might be a good idea to watch the <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit">github project</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've spent the past couple of days playing with <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com" target="_blank">Vagrant </a>, which is an add-on for <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a> that allows you to quickly build virtual machines, configured exactly how you want them, on a project by project basis. The advantage of this is that it lets you replicate your production environment (or as close to as is possible), which should hopefully reduce headaches when you deploy your updates. 

Vagrant VM's are portable, which means that all of your team members can have exactly the same development environment, regardless of their own system setups. Once again: less headaches.

<h3>Vagrant</h3>

How does it work? Well, first of all, you need the <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">latest version of VirtualBox</a>, and the vagrant gem. I installed it into my system gems, but there's no reason it couldn't be in your Gemfile if you're working on a ruby project.

<code>gem install vagrant</code>

Once it's all setup (read the <a href="http://vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/index.html" target="_blank">full instructions</a> for some additional steps), you need to initialise your directory:

<code>vagrant init</code>

This creates a file called "Vagrantfile" which configures your VM's for each project. The most basic file would look like this:

[gist id="2404819"]
Vagrant::Config.run do |config|
  config.vm.box = "lucid32"

This tells vagrant to start up a VM using an Ubuntu image. It will boot the VM, and then set a port redirect up so that you can SSH into the VM with the following:

<code>vagrant ssh</code>

That's all very handy, but of course, you're going to want your machine to have some software configured. Enter Chef, stage left.

<h3>Chef</h3>

<a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Home" target="_blank">Chef</a> is a framework that lets you create "recipes" to install and configure software on VM's. Basically, it's a scripting system for getting a blank VM up and running. 

As a good starting point, Opscode have a <a href="https://github.com/opscode/cookbooks/">great repository</a> of "cookbooks" (collections of recipes - natch) on github that you can fork and start using without having to make too many (if any) changes.

To work with Vagrant and Chef, you need a VM configured for Vagrant with a recent build of Ruby installed, as well as the chef. Setting up an Ubuntu 11.10 VM for Vagrant is relatively simple. Just follow steps 1-3 in <a href="http://www.yodi.me/blog/2011/10/26/build-base-box-vagrant-ubuntu-oneiric-11.10-server/">these instructions</a>.

Once that was complete, you need to install Ruby. Here's a <a href="http://boris.muehmer.de/2012/03/18/ruby-1-9-3-p125-from-source-on-ubuntu-10-04-lts/">quick guide</a> to installing Ruby 1.9.3-125 from source on Ubuntu.

Then I installed the chef gem

<code>gem install chef</code>

to get chef-client and chef-solo on the VM. <em>(Note: I'm only dealing with chef-solo in this post. chef-server adds a layer of difficulty that isn't necessary at this stage.)</em>

Once you have your base VM setup, you need to package it up for Vagrant, so it can load it up in VirtualBox as needed. 

[gist id="2405223"]
mkdir ~/Vagrant && cd ~/Vagrant

vagrant package --base vagrant-oneiric package.box

vagrant box add vagrant-oneiric package.box 
[/gist]

At this point, you should have a base VM ready for configuring with Chef.

<h3>Vagrant and Chef, sitting in a tree</h3>

Vagrant is built to work with provisioning software such as Chef (and <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">puppet</a>). You add a series of Chef commands to your Vagrantfile that it will run on your VM as it is being configured. 

To add recipes to your VM you just add the following to your Vagrantfile:

<code>chef.add_recipe("mysql::server")</code>

Chef allows for configuration settings, such as passwords and installation directories, to be passed through to recipes. Vagrant supports this as well:

[gist id="2404824"]
config.vm.provision :chef_solo do |chef|
  chef.json = {
    :mysql => {
      :server_root_password => "secretpassword"
    }
  }
  chef.add_recipe("mysql::server")
end
[/gist]

<h3>OpenPhoto</h3>

OpenPhoto is an open source photo service that allows you to retain control of your photos, rather than store them with some site that may not even exist in 3 years. Your photos are stored on AmazonS3 or on Dropbox, and you can run a server yourself to maintain total control over the whole setup if you wish, or use their hosted service available here: <a href="http://openphoto.me">http://openphoto.me</a>.

Being open source, anyone can contribute to the system, and as with most open source projects, they need as much help as they can get. So, I've started tinkering with it, and I thought it was a good candidate to run with Vagrant and Chef to setup test servers quickly and painlessly.

So, if you want to do the same, here's my Vagrantfile for my OpenPhoto directory, which is a git clone of my fork of the <a href="https://github.com/openphoto/frontend">OpenPhoto repository</a> on github. It should hopefully allow you to get up and running if you've done everything outlined above.

[gist id="2404532"]
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

Vagrant::Config.run do |config|
  config.vm.box = "vagrant-oneiric"

  config.vm.provision :chef_solo do |chef|
    chef.binary_path = "/path/to/chef/binary/"
    chef.cookbooks_path = "/path/to/chef/cookbooks"

    chef.json = {
      :mysql => {
        :server_root_password => "secretpassword"
      }
    }

    chef.add_recipe("mysql")
    chef.add_recipe("mysql::server")
    chef.add_recipe("apache2")
    chef.add_recipe("imagemagick")
    chef.add_recipe("php")
    chef.add_recipe("php::module_curl")
    chef.add_recipe("php::module_mysql")
    chef.add_recipe("php::module_apc")
    chef.add_recipe("php::module_dev")
    chef.add_recipe("php::module_imagick")
    chef.add_recipe("php::module_mcrypt")
    chef.add_recipe("php::module_gd")
    chef.add_recipe("apache2::mod_rewrite")
    chef.add_recipe("apache2::mod_deflate")
    chef.add_recipe("apache2::mod_headers")
    chef.add_recipe("apache2::mod_expires")
    chef.add_recipe("apache2::mod_php5")
    chef.add_recipe("git")
  end

  config.vm.share_folder "openphoto", "/var/www/openphoto", "/path/to/openphoto/frontend", :owner => "www-data", :group => "vagrant"

  config.vm.forward_port 80, 8080
end
[/gist]

Run 

<code>vagrant up</code>

and that will build your new VM using the base image, and then configure all of the required software. It might take a little while :)

One of the great things about Vagrant is that you can quickly share folders with your VM, which means I can edit files in my repository on my Mac, which are shared onto the VM. This is accomplished with this line:

[gist id="2404834"]
config.vm.share_folder "openphoto", "/var/www/openphoto", "/path/to/openphoto/frontend", :owner => "www-data", :group => "vagrant"
[/gist]

<h4>Apache</h4>

You'll also need to configure Apache to use this directory. Here's my config file:

[gist id="2405294"]
<VirtualHost *:80>
  DocumentRoot /var/www/openphoto/src/html

  <Directory "/var/www/openphoto/src/html">
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from all

    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule ^(.*)\?*$ index.php?__route__=/$1 [L,QSA]

    # 403 Forbidden for ini files
    RewriteRule \.ini$ - [F,NC]

    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/plain
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/css
    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/x-javascript
    BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4 gzip-only-text/html
    BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4\.0[678] no-gzip
    BrowserMatch \bMSIE !no-gzip !gzip-only-text/html 
  </Directory>

  # 404 Not Found for ini files
  #AliasMatch \.ini$    /404

  ExpiresActive On
  ExpiresByType text/javascript "A31536000"
  ExpiresByType application/x-javascript "A31536000"
  ExpiresByType text/css "A31536000"
  ExpiresByType image/x-icon "A31536000"
  ExpiresByType image/gif "A604800"
  ExpiresByType image/jpg "A604800"
  ExpiresByType image/jpeg "A604800"
  ExpiresByType image/png "A604800"
  
  Header set Cache-Control "must-revalidate"
  FileETag MTime Size
</VirtualHost>
[/gist]

You can then add a port forwarding rule to provide easy access to the Apache server running on the VM, like so:

<code>config.vm.forward_port 80, 8080</code>

Then, fire up "http://localhost:8080" in your browser, and you should be looking at your OpenPhoto install!
