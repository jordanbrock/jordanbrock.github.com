  <p>In the past year, Australia has gone from being able to strangle the opposition&#8217;s scoring at the end of an innings, to being having one of the most expensive bowling attacks in the world. Now, <a href="http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/281283.html">this article</a> doesn&#8217;t attempt to show why, but it certainly makes for alarming reading.</p>
<p>p. One of the most (for me at least) interesting tidbit is about bowlers like <a href="http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/columns/content/player/42272.html">Rana Naved-ul-Hasan</a> and <a href="http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/columns/content/player/50804.html">Chaminda Vaas</a>. The former is horrifically expensive during the first 40 overs of the game, but in the last 10 overs he is transformed into a miser. Vaas, on the other hand, is almost unplayable with the new ball, but turns into a regular pie-chucker in the last 10.</p>
<p>p. No doubt the teams have this type of statistics up the wazoo, but it makes me wonder why anyone is bowling <a href="http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/columns/content/player/6278.html">Brett Lee</a> in the last 10 overs, when his economy rate skyrockets. Of course, that&#8217;s <a href="http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/current/story/281294.html">not going to be an issue</a> in this world cup. Unfortunately.</p>
<p>p. On a side note, I wonder what that does to all of the sponsors plans for the tournament. No doubt companies like <a href="http://three.com.au">3 Mobile</a> and <a href="http://weetbix.com.au/">Weet-Bix</a> would have large campaigns centered around Lee for their advertising during the cup. Time for a <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=5n97H9bn0Hg">few new ideas</a> I think.</p>
