  <p>Sure, writing about <a href="http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/">Fake Steve Jobs</a> is way old news, but if you&#8217;re reading this blog for a desire for timely anything then you need to consider a trip to an electro-shock therapist. After he (Fake Steve) was outed by some killjoy at the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">WSJ</span></span> (or somewhere, can&#8217;t be bothered to do the research) there was a concern that the easter bunny had been killed and <span class="caps"><span class="caps">FSJ</span></span> wouldn&#8217;t be as funny or as insightful. It didn&#8217;t take long to see that <span class="caps"><span class="caps">FSJ</span></span> wasn&#8217;t going to take exposure lying down. In fact, he stepped into the realms of batshit insanity. And it was exactly the correct response.</p>
<p>p. Anyway, not long after the outing, he ran an article with a picture by James Duncan Davidson, but didn&#8217;t put any attribution on it. Kinda naughty, and actually a bit of a red rag, and he was called out. A quick apology was issued, followed by more mirth. For example, check out the photo credits on <a href="http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/2007/09/dear-early-iphone-adopters-yeah-we.html">these</a> <a href="http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/2007/09/okay-so-you-just-bought-iphone-and-now.html">two</a> posts. I didn&#8217;t know that <span class="caps"><span class="caps">FSJ</span></span> was such a fan of <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=_PPWDglTboI">Old Greg</a></p>
